[{"content":"Design of protein-binding proteins from the target structure alone The authors tackle the challenging task of designing proteins binding to a specific site on the surface of a target protein. They use a pretty neat analogy: a climbing wall with too few and distant hand- and foot-holds. Their approach then corresponds to (1) identify all the handholds and footholds; i.e list disembodied side-chain interactions with the target surface using a rapid look-up hash table, (2) have thousands of climbers try to climb the wall using subsets of the identified holds; i.e find protein backbones hosting many of the identified side chains without clashing with the target, (3) find the most promising routes, i.e. backbone motifs that occur frequently, and (4) have a second group of climbers explore them in detail, i.e generate scaffolds with the backbone motifs, and improve them with docking, design, and sequence and shape optimization. Each step and assumption of the overall approach was validated with many many experiments, including deep sequencing, cell sorting and interferometry to estimate binding affinity, saturation mutagenesis, and crystal structure determination. As usual, however, only a small fraction of designed proteins bind and even those need more work to make them into high affinity binders. But advances on the approaches described here combined with the sheer amount of high quality experimental data generated could easily make this better.\nComputational design of mechanically coupled axle-rotor protein assemblies Another protein design task: create customizable protein rotary nanomachines that couple biochemical free energy to mechanical work. First, the authors design ringlike \u0026ldquo;rotors\u0026rdquo; from helical repeats with a range of different inner diameters, and then a bunch of homooligomeric \u0026ldquo;axles\u0026rdquo; were designed to fit inside the rotors. These rigid, stable components (designed using many different approaches) then assembled into the final machines with the help of neat tricks such as longer range electrostatic interactions, disulphide bonds at rotor interfaces, and histidine-mediated hydrogen bond networks. Again, the assemblies used a multitude of different approaches as well. Comparing cryo-EM data with energy landscapes confirmed that the axle-rotor systems occupied multiple rotational states. Ever closer to an age where we draw out parametric machine blueprints and have proteins designed to match them!\nProtein structure representation learning Two papers, released within a week of each other, both describe deep learning architectures for self-supervised protein structure representation learning (as opposed to the sequence language models we all know and love). Both approach the task of predicting the sequence of a protein given its backbone atom coordinates. In Learning inverse folding from millions of predicted structures, the authors use a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder transformer with rotation-equivariant layers trained on backbone coordinates. In A Deep SE(3)-Equivariant Model for Learning Inverse Protein Folding, they instead use a graph transformer approach with residue and residue-pair features and attention restricted to spatially local residue pairs. The former includes a whopping 12 million AlphaFold-predicted structures during training, with lower plDDT residues masked. They also introduce a well-designed validation set without any domain, topological, or structural similarity to the training sets. They show a range of results - sequence design with masked inputs, protein complexes, multiple conformational states, and zero-shot prediction of mutational effects! The latter paper incorporates a series of masking strategies that take into account both linear and spatial neighbors, possible due to its graph-based approach, and shows better performance than sequence language models on TAPE.\nLearning functional properties of proteins with language models A very comprehensive review and benchmark of 23 protein representation learning models, overall using a variety of NLP approaches for training and a variety of input features, against each other and against classical approaches such as BLAST and HMMER. The authors put these approaches through a battery of tests including the prediction of semantic similarity based on GO terms, protein families, and protein-protein binding affinities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, ProtT5-XL and ProtALBERT from the highly popular ProtTrans models performed quite well across these tasks. Mut2Vec, a shallow Word2Vec approach which incorporates information about gene mutations, biomedical literature and PPIs outperformed the others in function prediction tasks indicating that including more than just sequence information may be the way to go. Also, HMMER was nearly as good as the deep learning approaches at inferring molecular function GO terms, confirming again that evolutionary info from MSAs can dramatically improve over single sequence information.\nCATHe: Detection of remote homologues for CATH superfamilies using embeddings from protein language models The authors train simple machine learning classifiers (a shallow ANN and a logistic regression model) on protein language model embeddings to predict CATH categories. They create quite a strict validation dataset, proteins with \u0026lt;20% sequence identity to training sets, to see if these models can detect very remote homologies. After seeing good performance there, the model was applied to over 4 million Pfam domains without CATH classifications, increasing the size of the CATH database by over 3%. For human Pfam domains with AlphaFold models, most of these predictions matched the structure. Exciting to see how the re-evaluation of CATH domains after the Uniref90 AlphaFold release will change our understanding of structure and function!\nFigure of the Week    a, Illustration of patterning concept, where small-molecule antigens (haptens) are arranged using short, flexible tethers at well-defined locations on DNA origami nanostructures.

In this work, Leman et al. modelled ~200,000 structures for diverse protein sequences without clear homologs from 1,003 representative metagenomes. This work was initiated 5 years ago, before the AlphaFold era, and modelling was carried out using Rosetta and DMPfold through a large-scale citizen science initiative, the World Community Grid project. What they found when putting all these structures in context (using a graphlet-based network embedding GRAFENE) is that, despite most of these proteins representing seemingly orphan genes, they adopt already known folds, with only ~160 novel folds uncovered, suggesting that structural space is saturated. They further predicted functions using DeepFri and unravelled various cases where the same function is mapped to unrelated folds, highlighting parallel, possibly backup functional routes. All together, this work demonstrates how large-scale protein sequence-structure-function predictions can highlight the origin and importance of seemingly metagenomic novelties.\nAn end-to-end deep learning method for rotamer-free protein side-chain packing Goodbye rotamer libraries? For decades they were the undisputed starting point for any side-chain reconstruction problem. Given a discrete set of possible side-chain conformations at each location, Monte Carlo or graph based algorithms provided solutions optimizing some pairwise energy function. Here, the authors present AttnPacker. AttnPacker uses spatial information derived from protein backbone coordinates to efficiently model residue and pairwise neighborhoods. This, coupled with an SE(3)-equivariant architecture, allows for the simultaneous prediction of all amino acid side-chain coordinates without the use of rotamer libraries or conformational sampling. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s fast, yes it\u0026rsquo;s accurate.\nDisentanglement of Entropy and Coevolution using Spectral Regularization Deep learning methods for protein structure prediction and other tasks often make heavy use of coevolutionary signal. These typically use statistical models to generate a matrix (modelling conservation and entropy) and a 4D tensor (modeling the coevolution). In tasks like contact prediction, the tensor is often also reduced to a matrix, representing the strength of residue-residue interactions in a protein. However, this matrix and the original tensor are highly correlated with entropy, remedied by performing a low-rank correction as a post-processing step. Approaches that use the tensor directly or don\u0026rsquo;t perform this correction may struggle to disentangle entropy from coevolution. The authors here propose a novel spectral regularizer that works by removing the dominant eigenmode of the coevolution matrix, thereby sparsifying the structural information and removing entropic correlation. They test their approach on contact prediction and sequence design tasks, and compete favourably with approaches requiring the post-processing step. They also show that their regularizer is interpretable, revealing attractive and repulsive interactions. Something like this will likely make its way into future structure prediction methods, to improve prediction as well as the learned hidden representations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 3: An overview of the protein space and examples of proteins generated by ProtGPT2.

When the method was published, it was noted that the local predicted LDDT (pLDDT) score correlated well with IDRs. In this short communication, the authors explore this concept further and experiment with other metrics, such as relative solvent accessibility, in order to benchmark IDR prediction by AlphaFold2. Additionally, they also evaluate how pLDDT and relative solvent accessibility can be used to identify regions that fold conditionally upon binding. The conclusion is that AlphaFold2 performs well in the prediction of IDRs but is two orders of magnitude slower and, thus, not the best choice for fast searches.\nStructure determination of high-energy states in a dynamic protein ensemble Like missing those couple of seconds giving out clues about who killed Mr. Thrombey, transitory high-energy conformations can contain crucial information about the mechanism of actions of proteins. In this paper, the authors describe a way to access them using paramagnetic NMR experiments, through the use of pseudocontact shifts (PCS). These PCS provide long-distance structural information that can be used as restraints to determine conformations using simulated annealing, starting from known structures. This method was applied to the adenylate kinase (Adk) metalloprotein enzyme for which only the closed and open conformations are known, and confirmed several observations made by FRET or meta-dynamics simulations. They also show that the method can be generalized to non-metalloproteins by using a metal-binding tag.\nStructure-informed microbial population genetics elucidate selective pressures that shape protein evolution A novel use-case for structure prediction, microbial population genetics. The authors look into evolutionary dynamics in a popular ocean surface microbe taxon through the lens of protein structure as predicted by AlphaFold2. For this, they calculate the rate of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations at each single codon variant site and compare this to relative solvent accessibility and distance from the (predicted) ligand site for the amino acid under consideration. Overall, synonymous variants were way more common than non-synonymous, but the rates of non-synonymous mutations displayed some pretty interesting trends. They were a lot more common in exposed sites vs. buried sites, and they tended to avoid active sites and ligand-binding sites, the first likely due to maintaining structural stability and the second to maintain function. For one protein involved in recycling nitrogen, correctly taking into account its quaternary structure brought forth the expected conclusion that non-synonymous variation again avoids buried and active sites in this protein. This, combined with possible errors in the prediction of ligand binding sites and the steric configurations of residues, means that care needs to be taken in such large-scale structural analyses - though the kinds of conclusions one can draw from them are definitely unique and complementary to the common nucleotide sequence-based analysis.\nFigure of the Week    Fig. 3: Linkers L1 and L2 mediate the structural transition to the active state.\na, Overview of the 18‚Äì20‚ÄâMM active conformation. b, c, Detailed view of HNH (b) and RuvC (c) active sites. d, Docking of the L1 linker helix against the PAM-distal gRNA‚ÄìTS duplex, shown as an isosurface representation. e, Interactions of L1 and L2 regions with the minor groove of the gRNA‚ÄìTS duplex.

This makes their annotation for functional features challenging but also more and more important. Metagenomic projects are an especially big source of novel protein sequences and while many for sure represent families completly new to us, a much bigger fraction most likely correspond to highly divergent forms of well known families that just escape detection by HMM-based annotation methods. In this work, the authors trained a network on the domain families in Pfam and demonstrate how deep learning allows the annotation and classification of sequences seemingly without clear homologs, expanding the annotation coverage of the protein universe. The method is useful for the annotation of single domain sequences and allowed for the merging of DUF families with others well known. It does not, however, map annotations into the full-length sequence. The authors circumvent the annotation of multi-domain sequences without known domain boundaries by using a sliding window. The code is freely available and a Colab notebook makes it really convenient to play with your favourite protein. One word of caution however: while powerful and indeed superior in sensitivity to HMMs, the network always provides a result; it always finds the closest annotation in embeded space for a given sequence, even if it is really far away.\nIn silico evolution of nucleic acid-binding proteins from a nonfunctional scaffold The authors tackle the fascinating problem of designing proteins with a given function, using simulated directed evolution. To make the task even more challenging they demonstrate their approach, Proseeker, on a completely de novo designed repeat protein with no existing function, designed just to optimize its consecutive alpha-helix folding capabilities. To imbue this protein with nucleotide-binding functionality, the authors create an assessment library of phycochemical descriptors describing short peptides from pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, specifically those covering the RNA-binding residues. These descriptors are clustered and any newly evolved protein is compared to the representative descriptors from each cluster to determine its fitness. Two residues are mutated at each step in the process, with residues around the first mutation site getting a small boost in being selected as the second mutation site, so as to boost creation of mutational islands and epistatic interactions. Then, selection is done computationally using DP-Bind - an SVM trained to predict DNA binding ability. The top scoring 10% variants are used to generate the next round of mutants. Proseeker is experimentally validated by producing five synthetically evolved proteins and running multiple in vitro and in vivo (with a pretty neat new design) assays, showing that three of them actually do have nucleotide-binding activity, an amazing result. Another nice result of the paper is describing all the different variables that are important for getting this kind of approach to work, and systematically varying each one to show its effect - of course this is only possible since the evolution is in silico!\nPyUUL provides an interface between biological structures and deep learning algorithms For the structural biologists who were not born with Machine Learning or fancy Neural Networks (NN), using these new methods can be sometimes intimidating. pyUUL is one of those tools that will help sand down some of the rough edges and make you finally jump on the bandwagon like the other cool kids. The aim of this package is to transform any 3D structures of your choice (protein, small molecules or nucleic acids) into a meaningful representations (voxel-based, surface or volumetric point-cloud) directly exploitable by any NN architecture. At the end, this idea is simple, but nonetheless very powerful. The authors also present multiple test cases, ranging from alpha helix identification, structure-based clustering and small-molecule optimization. Based on PyTorch, all the operations can be run on both CPU and GPU. The package is available here and more importantly it comes with documentation describing some of the examples presented in the papers.\nSystematic evaluation of computational tools to predict the effects of mutations on protein stability in the absence of experimental structures Methods for the prediction of protein stability upon mutation are usually evaluated and developed with experimental structures in mind. With the vast majority of structures for proteins being models and predictions, the authors tackled the question of how common mutation stability prediction tools would perform on protein structure models. They evaluated the performance of 14 protein stability predictors on a self-created data set of models based on a curated subset of structures in the ProTherm data set using MODELLER and AlphaFold2. The authors found that the protein stability predictions deteriorate for homology models with a target-template identity below 40%; especially for machine learning and structure based methods. The predictions on AlphaFold2 models were mostly consistent with predictions on experimental structures, which opens up stability predictions with the same accuracy as in experimental structures to all proteins. A limitation we see here is the entanglement of the evaluation of the models of proteins in the ProTherm data base, which is usually also used for the development of stability prediction methods.\nExploring protein-protein interactions at the proteome level The biological activity of proteins is defined by how they interact with other biological molecules, from small ligands, to nucleic acids, sugars and other proteins. Usually proteins do not act by themselves, and form strong or transient complexes with other proteins, building large macromolecular machines or transient interaction networks. It is thus essential to not only understand the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins but also in complex with their interaction partners. In this review, Elhabashy et al. discuss the different approaches available to analyse, predict and model such interactions at a large-scale. From experimental methods, to computational and hybrid approaches, they provide a concise but extremely informative and insightful state-of-the-art for the modelling of protein-protein interactions at the proteome level, also highlighting the recent role of machine learning in such tasks.\nFigure(s) of the Week(s)    Figure 1.

They can be used to annotate folds, find remote homologous relationships undetected at the sequence level, or for fold classification. In this paper, van Kempen et al. describe Foldseek, the MMseqs2 of protein structure alignment. The method is based on a novel type of structural alphabet with 20 states that describes for each residue i the geometric conformation with its spatially closest residue j, thus differentiating it from structural alphabets that don\u0026rsquo;t consider spatial neighbours. Structures are compared based on their \u0026ldquo;sequence\u0026rdquo; in this alphabet using the MMseqs2 approach, and then aligned locally or globally. Foldseek is as sensitive as TMalign and almost as sensitive as DALI, but it is considerably faster! As an example, the authors show that Foldseek does in 5 seconds what would take TMalign 33 hours and Dali 10 days. The online availability of Foldseek as a server, allows users to query their favourite structure against the AlphaFold database or the PDB, and the easy installation process allows for extremely fast many-against-many sensitive structure comparisons.\nConformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins and flexible multidomain proteins A comprehensive review on generating integrated conformational ensembles for proteins with different levels of conformational heterogeneity. The authors start off by describing typical steps in ensemble determination: computational conformation sampling, experimental methods to determine structure, forward models to calculate experimental observables from the ensemble, and finally refining the ensemble based on the experimental output. They then go into detail on a few examples of multidomain protein and protein-nucleic acid complexes, lipid membranes, multimodal ensembles with different subpopulations, and small-molecule binding. The authors also discuss some interesting future opportunities - improving force fields and forward models, using computational structure prediction methods instead of experimental methods now that they are more comparable, and looking more into different time scales and heterogenous mixtures of proteins.\nEquiBind: Geometric Deep Learning for Drug Binding Structure Prediction In EquiDock, the authors introduced a new graph neural network approach for rigid protein-protein docking, by training the network to output the Euclidean SE(3) transformation (i.e the rotation and translation) required to move one protein (labelled the \u0026ldquo;ligand\u0026rdquo;) with respect to the other (labelled the receptor). This approach had a couple of neat features: it\u0026rsquo;s SE(3)-equivariant, meaning it returns the same docked complex irrespective of the inital orientations and positions of the input proteins; it uses a k-NN protein graph as input with SE(3)-invariant edge features based on local coordinate frames, the same approach used by AlphaFold; it uses multi-headed attention to find \u0026ldquo;keypoints\u0026rdquo; for each protein, with learning ensuring that these represent binding pockets, and then optimally aligns the \u0026ldquo;ligand\u0026rdquo; protein to match these keypoints; and it\u0026rsquo;s very very fast. Now EquiBind extends this approach to solve small molecule docking instead, with a key addition - the ligand, which is now a small molecule represented in a similar manner as the protein graph, is flexible! This is acheived by learning deformations of the atom point cloud and then rotating torsion angles in the ligand to best match the deformed point cloud. EquiBind takes mere seconds, perfect for virtual screening.

From the prediction of protein sequence features and the classification of protein families, to important contributions to protein structure prediction. In this paper, Hie et al go a step further and use them to model protein sequence evolution as a \u0026ldquo;walk through the protein sequence landscape\u0026rdquo;. Based on the ESM-1b protein language model, which the authors say learnt general protein evolutionary patterns, they developed an approach that used distances in embedded space to build a sequence similarity network on top of which they map a \u0026ldquo;vector field\u0026rdquo; that translates into the evolutionary dynamics within the sequences analysed. The approach starts by the computation of the sequence embeddings for a target set of sequences using the language model. KNN as implemented in UMAP is then used to find the neighbours of each sequence in embedded space, mimicking a sequence similarity network. Then, the change in the language model pseudo-likelihood in each edge is used to assign a \u0026ldquo;velocity\u0026rdquo; vector whose direction represents an evolutionary transition. While it is not clear to me why this last step has the evolutionary meaning claimed, the authors demonstrate that for different protein families the internal structure of resulting network and the vector field generated captures their known evolutionary patterns. What makes this work even more exciting is that the method is made available as a python package (evolocity), which relies on Scanpy and anndata, two other packages that facilitate the analysis of large multidimensional annotated data. The package comes with multiple tutorials that can be run in Google Colab; this makes it easier to explore it for our favourite sets of sequences. But be warned: you may run into crashes due to memory overload in Colab. Nevertheless, it is exciting that such a tool is now made easily available and, while there is some amount of flexibility within the package, the expansion to other clustering methods and further language models would make it even more rich.\nScalable Fragment-Based 3D Molecular Design with Reinforcement Learning The authors describe an interesting molecule design method that combines Markov decision processes with machine learning. It consists in a hierarchical agent that sequentially places molecular fragments with predefined shapes in 3D space. They compare this methodology with the intuition of an organic chemist who, when faced with a task to modify a molecule, would think of it in terms of adding new fragments and functional groups rather than single atoms. This method allows building molecules with more than 100 atoms, a task that other approaches that take the 3D structure into consideration usually fail to accomplish. Moreover, they suggest that it is possible to optimize different properties during the design process, like hydrophilicity or the affinity with a specific pocket. This makes this method extremely versatile, leading to many potential applications such as: small molecule and peptide drug design or design of ligands and organocatalysts.\nMolecular electronics sensors on a scalable semiconductor chip: A platform for single-molecule measurement of binding kinetics and enzyme activity The future is now! The authors realise the 70s' dream of using single molecules as circuit elements, with a CMOS-integrated circuit chip consisting of an array of nanoelectrode-based single-molecule sensors \u0026ldquo;bridged\u0026rdquo; by a molecular wire between the nanoelectrodes. The biomolecule of interest is conjugated to the bridge molecule to act as a probe (a process that takes 10 seconds), the target molecule is added into the equation, and then the current through the bridge is monitored - if the target molecule interacts with the probe then this can be seen via the current pulses. And not just seen either - Hidden Markov models are used to analyse the current signals, with bound and unbound being the hidden states, and by comparing the fraction of bound vs unbound across different target concentrations they obtain pretty accurate estimates for the binding affinity $K_d$ as well! The authors demonstrate an impressive variety of applications - DNA hybridization of complementary oligos (including determining the melting temperature of the DNA duplex, and showing sensitivity to introduced mismatches), protein and small-molecule binding, DNA aptamer-target binding (shown using aptamers designed to bind SARS-CoV2 proteins), and enzyme activity (shown using a CRISPR/Cas system with the guide RNA targeting the Spike protein gene, and by distinguishing between DNA polymerase enzyme incorporation events) among others. They even show that adding a bunch of saliva or other highly complex contaminants doesn\u0026rsquo;t mess up sensing, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for diagnostic tests. Overall, the chip is sensitive and specific, can be multiplexed to target many kinds of interactions and molecules, highly scalable way past Moore\u0026rsquo;s law, fast (seconds) and cheap (~1$). Looks like a bright future for obtaining high quality drug-target binding affinity data to train our methods!\nFigure of the Week   Source: Scalable Fragment-Based 3D Molecular Design with Reinforcement Learning\nSome more  Cryo-EM and artificial intelligence visualize endogenous protein community members What stabilizes pre-folded structures in the intrinsically disordered Œ±-helical binding motifs?

The authors describe a significant step in that direction by simulating a living minimal cell (JCVI-syn3A) with over 7000 reactions governing the evolution of its metabolites, proteins, mRNAs, tRNAs, DNA and ribosomes. A coarse grained spatially resolved model (at 4 nm resolution) was initialised based on cryo-ET images providing the cell morphology and the location of the ribosomes while other macromolecules were added to it. Simulations were run with a hybrid stochastic and deterministic setup both on the spatially resolved model and on a simpler well stirred model without spatial heterogeneity. The latter was necessary as the computational cost for the spatial model was too high and growth of the cell could not properly be accounted for yet. Future work should address these limitations, but the current model was already able to showcase interesting emerging behaviours which fit well with experimental observations while providing additional time-resolved details. For instance, the authors could measure distributions of mRNA half-lives and protein production, when and where ATP was used, connections between metabolism and cell growth, and DNA replication events.\nPetabase-scale sequence alignment catalyses viral discovery The authors perform a high throughput alignment-based sequence search across over 10 petabytes of sequence read data with the purpose of identifying new RNA viruses. Their approach has a higher sensitivity than k-mer index approaches, while being much faster than de novo assembly approaches. The viral search is underpinned by a \u0026ldquo;palmprint\u0026rdquo; - a set of three essential motifs in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which form its catalytic core. Novel palmprints identified across the huge database increased the number of known RNA viruses nearly ten-fold. The authors then focus on three relevant viral families - Coronoviridae (of SARS-CoV-2 fame), delta virus (such as the one causing viral hepatitis), and huge phages from microbiome research. The polished and comprehensive Serratus website provides access to all these analyses and the raw data. You can even find matches for your own virus of interest.\nCellular homologs of the double jelly-roll major capsid proteins clarify the origins of an ancient virus kingdom Viruses are a distinct group of biological entitites and their origin is a hotly debated problem. While most core components of most viral lineages seem to precede the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), there are indications that, within various structural components, different capsid proteins may have evolved from the recruitment of diverse cellular proteins, especially those involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates. In this study, the authors investigate the origins of the major capsid protein of a broad variety of double-stranded DNA viruses, a protein long thought to represent a viral innovation. Using protein structure comparison, they traced this protein family to a bacterial cellular ancestor likely involved in carbohydrate metabolism, rephrasing the history of these viruses while reinforcing the chimeric view on virus origins.\nFigure of the Week   Source: Towards Controllable Protein design with Conditional Transformers\nSome more  AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery: Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small Molecule Inhibitor Proteome-scale mapping of binding sites in the unstructured regions of the human proteome Fragment Hotspot Mapping to Identify Selectivity-Determining Regions between Related Proteins The computational models of AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold carry protein foldability information Design in the DARK: Learning Deep Generative Models for De Novo Protein Design Enhancing protein inter-residue real distance prediction by scrutinising deep learning models Label-free visual proteomics: Coupling MS- and EM-based approaches in structural biology Towards Controllable Protein design with Conditional Transformers Lira: Rotational Invariant Shape and Electrostatic Descriptors for Small Molecules and Protein Pockets based on Real Spherical Harmonics ATLIGATOR: Editing protein interactions with an atlas-based approach The AlphaFold Database now has over a million structures  On Neglected Tropical Disease Day, we teamed up with @DeepMind to publish 190,000+ relevant protein structure predictions in the #AlphaFold database ‚Äì freely available to all! #WorldNTDDay #beatNTDhttps://t.co/Mvq4cC2ilI pic.twitter.com/IRUXwq6pVg\n\u0026mdash; EMBL-EBI (@emblebi) January 28, 2022  ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/11/","summary":"This week we look at a fully simulated living cell and explore viruses","title":"Issue 11"},{"content":"Quantifying structural relationships of metal-binding sites suggests origins of biological electron transfer Motivated by how crucial redox reactions are for life, the authors take a look at how early in molecular evolution catalysis of such reactions has emerged. They found a couple of small motifs, binding metals or metal-associated ligands, of similar geometry and sequence used across all proteins. That may be seen as indicator that peptides with redox functionality could have existed before first proteins. At the core of the study, a new structure-annotated homology, ligand-extended (sahle) score is used to calculate a distance between structural fragments. After reducing fragment space to representatives, the distance network is transformed into a minimum spanning tree (MSP) and enriched with genomic data to get phylogeny attached to the fragments. This leads to a small set of central motifs which serve as origin for the rest of the MSP. Verifying their central motifs with other studies leads the authors to the assumption that peptides carrying those motifs may have existed more than 3.8 billion years ago.\nFolding the unfoldable: Using AlphaFold to explore spurious proteins  The authors apply AlphaFold2 to AntiFam, which contains 250 sequence profiles annotated as \u0026ldquo;spurious\u0026rdquo; proteins, either because they are believed to be spurious translations, they overlap with known non-coding RNA genes, or because they are found on the opposite strand of known genes. Their first result is that there is a strong correlation between the mean plDDT and the length of the sequence, with shorter sequences showing higher mean plDDT both with the AntiFam sequences and with randomly generated amino acid sequences. But, ignoring sequences \u0026lt;100 residues, the mean plDDT scores are higher for SwissProt proteins compared to AntiFam spurious proteins. This proved false for only one AntiFam entry, and on closer inspection it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of evidence for this entry representing real functional proteins - so the authors deposited this entry back into Pfam. Overall a nice analysis showing that AlphaFold2 can provide an additional quality control estimate for spurious protein profiles, with the caveat that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used for short sequence lengths.\nCan AlphaFold2 predict the impact of missense mutations on structure? No, it can not. The authors show three examples in which AlphaFold2 fails in predicting the ‚Äòstructure-disrupted‚Äô protein successfully. This is not that surprising considering the fact that AlphaFold is trained mostly on wild type structures and it is supposed to be resistant to noise. However they offer an interesting showcase analyzing those examples in detail.\nFigure of the Week    Fig. 1. Cryo-EM structure of the Omicron spike protein.

In this review, the authors discuss the most recent computational advancements that complement established biophysical methods in the characterization of protein-protein interactions. From the use of the massive amount of genomic data now available, to the application of co-evolution analyses and the advent of highly accurate protein structure prediction methods based on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, this review is a concise but extremely rich overview of the current state of the computational contributions to the field. It shows how more and more intermingled different disciplines are becoming in the field, and how that interdisciplinarity is taking us at warp speed closer to the modelling of large protein-protein interaction networks that explain key biological processes.\nHarnessing protein folding neural networks for peptide‚Äìprotein docking The authors tackle protein-peptide complexes with AlphaFold2, by attaching the peptide sequence to the protein sequence with a long polyglycine linker. They obtain impressive results on a small set and slightly worse but still inspiring results on a larget set, all without the need for the elusive peptide MSA. AF2 performed best on complexes with peptide-binding motifs and in fact pLDDT scores could be used as a motif discovery tool. One curious result that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before is that AF2 always models the bound conformation, even if the interaction involves PTMs and ligands and even if only the free receptor is given as input, indicating some memorization of bound complexes without the underlying biophysics. All in all, PFPD (the main competitor in this paper) looks for a bound conformation of the peptide in solved monomer structures and then docks it with the protein, while AF2 assumes that peptide binding is just another step in the protein folding process. Since these produced complementary results, the future could hold adaptive methods that combine the two concepts for even more accurate protein-peptide complex modelling.\nEarly Computational Detection of Potential High Risk SARS-CoV-2 Variants Harmless mutation or the next big threat? The authors aim to implement an early warning system (EWS) combining structural modelling with AI to detect and monitor high risk SARS-CoV-2 variants. Already Hie et al. (PMID: 33446556) modelled the ability for viruses to mutate and evade the human immune system using natural language processing models. This has been lifted to a whole new level and complemented by predicted binding affinities of Spike to human ACE2 and other priors. Guess what? Omicron shined up brightly from day one. We would appreciate more specifics from the authors though. In particular, binding affinity calculations lack the details required for reproducibility.\nFigure of the Week    Fig. 2: Series of energy landscapes for the hemagglutinin fusion peptide membrane insertion simulated by molecular dynamics.

The schematic shows how a non-equilibrium process (insertion into a membrane) can be approximated by a trajectory involving a series of energy landscapes.

This library, typically filtered based on the ligand of interest, ligand size, or sequence identity to the protein of interest, serves as a search database for finding pockets in a query protein, with the filtering reducing the search time down from days to hours. The search itself depends on a structure alignment of the sphere to the entire query protein, returning multiple detected pockets and improving upon pocket detection performance state-of-the-art even at low sequence identities. Surprisingly, side-chain conformations do not improve performance. In another experiment, the authors also show that binding affinity is similar across similar pockets.\nImproving AlphaFold modeling using implicit information from experimental density maps In this paper the authors bring AlphaFold into the integrative modelling and iterative model building realms, proposing a new approach for protein model building starting from its sequence and experimental cryo-EM map. From an initial AlphaFold2 model, the authors propose an iterative approach where that model is fit into the density, remodelled based on it, and fed back as a template for another round of AlphaFold2 structure prediction. They applied the approach to the modelling of 25 cryo-EM structures and, in most cases, the procedure allowed for the building of models at a better accuracy than the initial AlphaFold model. While here they combine AlphaFold models with cryo-EM map interpretation, the approach is general and can be extended to any other protein structure prediction method and map-based biophysical approach, thus paving the way to the development of further synergic methods for better modelling of protein structures at atomic level of accuracy.\nAlphaFold2-aware protein-DNA binding site prediction using graph transformer The authors present GraphSite, a graph-based predictor of DNA binding sites at a residue level. This tool is based on a graph representation of the protein in which the residues are the nodes, and uses a transformer architecture to classify them. The nodes features are generated using both multiple sequence alignment and structural information. To do so, they predict the structure with AlphaFold-2 and extract the intermediate representation generated by the network. Moreover, they extract several structural properties from the predicted model such as backbone angles and accessible surface area. This method offers very good classification performances compared both to the sequence-based and structure-based state-of-the-art methods. Unsurprisingly, predicted structure quality can greatly affect performance. The authors also mention an interesting possible extension of their approach: adding edge features encoding residue distance or AlphaFold2 intermediate pair representations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1.

Given a query ligand and target protein, ComBind finds other distinct ligands binding to that protein, docks all of them, and then picks poses for each ligand optimizing a potential shared across all the ligands, i.e. one that rewards protein-ligand interactions shared across different ligands. The same potentials are also used as a proxy for relative binding affinities, perfect for virtual screening. Quite a nice discussion comparing this to previous work and on integrating this concept with future improvements in docking and virtual screening.\nPredictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning The emergence of SARS-CoV 2 variants with multiple, combined mutations rises the concern that the virus may fall into an evolutionary path that promotes the escaping of multiple classes of neutralizing antibodies. In this paper, the authors combined yeast display with deep sequencing to interrogate a massive sequence space of combinatorial mutations, representing billions of variants of the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. This allowed them to generate a large, experimental labelled dataset of sequences that could then be used to train two machine learning models (a random forest and a long-short-term-memory recurrent neural network) that predict, at very high accuracy, whether a given variant would interact with the ACE2 enzyme and, if so, would escape four commercial neutralizing antibodies. The models may enable researchers to select candidate antibody therapeutics and could be used as a de facto monitoring system, helping researchers to prospectively identify future variants with the highest likelihood of emergence.\nConformational variation in enzyme catalysis: A structural study on catalytic residues A very thorough analysis of the flexibility of catalytic residues from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas across over 900 enzyme families and across the entire PDB. Some conclusions: there\u0026rsquo;s a high structural conservation of the active site across enzymes from the same family almost regardless of the sequence similarity; most active sites exhibit some degree of flexibility, half of which is accounted for by only side chain motion; the highest RMSD variability is observed when comparing ligand-free and ligand-bound active sites; \u0026ldquo;reactant\u0026rdquo; residues (proton donor, acceptor, and shuttle) are more rigid than \u0026ldquo;spectator\u0026rdquo; (electrostatic stabiliser, activator, steric role) residues; and, based on their RMSD distributions, active sites can be broadly divided into inherently rigid, inherently flexible, open/closed, and extensively variable. Look out for their CSA-3D Python library which will help generalize analyses on catalytic sites like this one.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1.

RBD libraries are screened by FACS for binding to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, both binding and non-binding (escape) populations are isolated and subjected to deep sequencing. Machine learning models are trained to predict binding status to ACE2 or antibodies based on RBD sequence. Machine learning models are then used to predict ACE2 binding and antibody escape on current and prospective variants and lineages.\n Source: Predictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning\nSome more  SARS-CoV-2 variants impact RBD conformational dynamics and ACE2 accessibility Synthon-based ligand discovery in virtual libraries of over 11 billion compounds Learning physics confers pose-sensitivity in structure-based virtual screening InDeep: 3D fully convolutional neural networks to assist in silico drug design on protein-protein interactions A novel sequence-based predictor for identifying and characterizing thermophilic proteins using estimated propensity scores of dipeptides Constructing synthetic-protein assemblies from de novo designed 310 helices Version 3 of Improved prediction of protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold2  \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;In short two major things have changed 1) We have introduced a pDockQ score that predicts the DockQ score for each protein-protein interactions.

The network was trained on a dataset generated by the authors - they divided pockets into 14 different classes by clustering them according to the Tanimoto coefficient of the corresponding ligand. They validated the method by randomly splitting the dataset into a training and a testing set multiple times and averaging the obtained accuracies. Overall, they obtained a good prediction accuracy, but it would be interesting to observe the tool performances on an ‚Äòexternal‚Äô dataset.\nModeling Alternate Conformations with Alphafold2 via Modification of the Multiple Sequence Alignment Yet another approach to coerce different conformations from AlphaFold2. We\u0026rsquo;ve covered two others just in the past two weeks. Even Deepmind ran into this for an elusive multi-drug transporter (LmrP) where vanilla AF2 only yielded one conformation - they pared the MSA and templates to only include structures with the other conformation and submitted the alternate conformations produced to CASP14. This paper builds on this idea in a novel way and gives us a neat procedure that can be more generally applied - make an AF2 model, pinpoint possible contact points (either from examining other crystal structures, prior knowledge from mutation studies, or just picking residues connecting two domains), then in-silico mutate the entire MSA at the chosen positions to alanine so that the attention network inside AF2, which depends on co-evolutionary signal, is forced to look elsewhere.\nNavigating Chemical Space by Interfacing Generative Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Docking A protein structure-aware molecular library preparation approach! A generative variational autoencoder is trained on molecular structures to obtain a latent space. Starting from an initial library, each reference molecule is embedded into this pretrained latent space and new molecules are selected from the neighborhood. These new molecules are docked to a target protein and those with the highest predicted binding affinity are chosen as the new set of reference molecules, and the process continues to narrow down the library to high affinity binders. There\u0026rsquo;s interactive TMAP plots covering some of their example runs - a really nice way of visualizing the greedy algorithm\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 8.

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the structural properties of the complex using atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics. They observe that variants of concern tend to stabilize the RBD-ACE2 complex. The mutations N501Y (Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ strain) and E484Q (Œ∫ strain) particularly increase complex stability. N501Y is also shown to not affect antibody neutralization in a significant way. This analysis workflow might be generally applicable for the analysis of the impact of future viral mutations on infection-induced immunity.\nMulti-State Modeling of G-protein Coupled Receptors at Experimental Accuracy The authors observed the propensity of AlphaFold to model the inactive conformation of the members of the GPCR family. Presumably, this happens because of training based on the PDB where inactive state GPCR structures are overrepresented. However, they could successfully model the active state of the structures by using as input only templates from state-annotated GPCR databases and, surprisingly, avoiding the use of MSA input features. This work shows how it is possible to induce AlphaFold to model a specific conformation of a structure as long as experimental structures in multiple states are available to form state-specific template databases.\nAlphaFill: enriching the AlphaFold models with ligands and co-factors Already at the time of the CASP experiment, it was noted that even without the knowledge about ligands, especially metals, AlphaFold was able to accurately predict the right side chain orientation of ligand binding sites. Now that more than 300,000 structural models across 21 proteomes are available, that becomes even more evident, with AlphaFold predicting confidently even the structure of those proteins that require smaller molecules for folding. Missing from the models, however, are those ligands; AlphaFold does not predict (let\u0026rsquo;s say, yet) ligands. What AlphaFill provide is a glimpse into those ligands. By looking for close homologs of known structure with a ligand bound, the AlphaFill service (available as a database), \u0026ldquo;fills\u0026rdquo; the ligand-binding sites of AlphaFold models with those from the homologs. Neat and simple, the AlphaFill database provides a quite unique and super informative look into the structural coverage provided by the AlphaFold database.\nFigure of the Week    Fig 4. Neural network interpretation. (A) A UMAP projection of the latent space of the GB1 sequence convolutional network (CNN), as captured at the last internal layer of the network. In this latent space, similar variants are grouped together based on the transformation applied by the network to predict the functional score. Variants are colored by their true functional score, where red represents high-scoring variants and blue represents low-scoring variants. The clusters marked G1 and G2 correspond to variants with mutations at core residues near the start and end of the sequence, respectively. Cluster G3 corresponds to variants with mutations at surface interface residues. (B) Integrated gradients feature importance values for the Pab1 CNN, aggregated at each sequence position and superimposed on the protein‚Äôs three-dimensional structure. Blue represents positions with negative attributions, meaning mutations in those positions push the network to output lower scores, and red represents positions with positive attributions. (C) A heat map showing predictions for all single mutations from the Pab1 CNN. Wild-type residues are indicated with dots, and the asterisk is the stop codon. Most single mutations are predicted to be neutral or deleterious.\n Source: Neural networks to learn protein sequence‚Äìfunction relationships from deep mutational scanning data\nSome more  De novo protein design by deep network hallucination Real-Time Structure Search and Structure Classification for AlphaFold Protein Models Loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mutations have profoundly different effects on protein structure: implications for variant effect prediction MUfoldQA_G: High-accuracy protein model QA via retraining and transformation Neural networks to learn protein sequence‚Äìfunction relationships from deep mutational scanning data Quantifying the binding landscapes of protein‚Äìprotein interactions AlphaFold Models Illuminate Half of Dark Human Proteins EnzyHTP: A High-Throughput Computational Platform for Enzyme Modeling Protein loop modeling and refinement using deep learning models Ten things I \u0026lsquo;hate\u0026rsquo; about refinement How Communication Pathways Bridge Local and Global Conformations in an IgG4 Antibody: a Molecular Dynamics Study  ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/5/","summary":"This week we look at SARS-CoV-2 variants, inducing AlphaFold into giving us multiple states, and filling AlphaFold models with small molecules","title":"Issue 5"},{"content":"Correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively in the inference of protein partners from sequences With all the new research on the prediction of protein complexes (see Issue #2), figuring out if two proteins interact is an old problem in need of new ideas and approaches. In this paper, the authors ask how the two pillars of coevolutionary analysis contribute to the inference of interaction - these are the phylogenetic correlation (often seen as a confounder and corrected for in direct coupling analysis), and the correlation of structural contacts. Using synthetic data combining different levels of phylogenetic and structural constraints, the authors discover that both contribute to the performance of interaction prediction, and that the presence of one may compensate for the absence of the other - e.g phylogenetically correlated non-contacting sites help when there\u0026rsquo;s fewer structurally contacting sites. Seems like an adaptive approach that uses phylogeny when proteins are closely related, and corrects for it otherwise might be a future direction to explore.\nVIVID: a web application for variant interpretation and visualisation in multidimensional analyses The authors created a useful tool which allows the user to go from called variants to the corresponding AlphaFold2 models in one go. Besides the mapping of variants from any organism or disease onto protein structures and their respective contact maps, you also get an analysis of the stability change with DynaMut2 and the changed interactions between mutated residue and environment with the Arpeggio tool. All this is combined in an easy-to-use web page which allows to download multiple results which can be used for further analysis downstream in other programs.\nCharacterizing disease-associated human proteins without available protein structures or homologues The authors of the paper took advantage of the most recent deep learning techniques (AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold) to model human disease-associated proteins. Afterwards, they used available tools to predict ligand binding sites, protein-protein interfaces and conserved regions in the models with high confidence scores. Finally, they checked whether the disease-associated mutations of the modeled proteins are in proximity of the predicted functional sites, or if they are destabilizing for the protein according to FoldX. In this way they were able to provide some rationale for most of the mutations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1. Pipeline of DomBpred.

The first input, rapamycin, activates kinase activity and the second input, blue light, inactivates kinase activity. Analogous to hardware engineering complexities, inactivation wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fast as activation because of biological reasons. Similar setups could be applied to different kinds of proteins, giving us an arsenal of controllable protein agents for use in biomedicine and biotech.\nToward More General Embeddings for Protein Design: Harnessing Joint Representations of Sequence and Structure In Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, a transformer was trained on a huge dataset of sequences to embed proteins into a biologically meaningful learned embedding space. Here, the authors use this pre-trained model to generate sequence features, combine them with a graph representation of structures, and train a rotation and translation equivariant transformer to generate an embedding. This embedding performs better at mutation thermostability prediction likely because it\u0026rsquo;s able to take into account sequentially-distant structurally-close influences. Of course this structural information can come from computationally predicted structures as well, following the trend in this post-AlphaFold era of replacing or augmenting sequence-based approaches with structure.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1: Summary of the workflow, landscapes, and splits. (A) General FLIP workflow: choose landscapes and splits that match user needs, train models and make predictions on the test set, and then compare to baseline models. (B) We choose landscapes that cover different types of sequence diversity. The GB1 landscape focuses on simultaneous mutation of four epistatic sites with nearly complete coverage [41] (PDB ID: 2GI9 [42]). The AAV capsid protein landscape sparsely samples sequences with up to 28 mutations, including insertions and deletions, to the the binding interface [43] (PDB ID: 6IH9 [44]). The thermostability landscape [45] measures a property shared by proteins from multiple functional groups across different domains of life. (C). We also provide up to seven suggested data splits for each landscape, which are described in Section 3.\n Source: FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins\nSome more  Computational design of nanoscale rotational mechanics in de novo protein assemblies Science Forum: Nanoscape, a data-driven 3D real-time interactive virtual cell environment FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins Deep learning methods for designing proteins scaffolding functional sites ParaFold: Paralleling AlphaFold for Large-Scale Predictions #COVIDisAirborne: AI-Enabled Multiscale Computational Microscopy of Delta SARS-CoV-2 in a Respiratory Aerosol Computational Structural Genomics Unravels Common Folds and Novel Families in the Secretome of Fungal Phytopathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Contrastive learning on protein embeddings enlightens midnight zone at lightning speed Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins  ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/3/","summary":"This week there\u0026rsquo;s SARS-CoV-2 structures, protein computing agents, and sequence-structure embeddings.","title":"Issue 3"},{"content":"A bundle of protein interactomes This week, three different papers addressing the 3-dimensional modelling of protein interactions at the cellular level were released, all paving the way to the automated and high-accuracy modelling of entire cells in 3D. The first, Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes, addresses the problem of predicting the composition and accurately modelling the 3D structure of protein macromolecular assemblies at the same time. The combination of RoseTTAFold for pair prediction with AlphaFold2 for structure modelling allowed for the construction of more than 1000 protein-protein assemblies from baker‚Äôs yeast. This not only included previously known interactions, but also more than 100 unknown others that may highlight previously unknown functions.\nIn the second paper, Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network, the authors use AlphaFold2 to model the 3-dimensional structure of more than 60‚Äô000 previously known protein interactions in the human proteome, providing building blocks to the construction of larger assemblies.\nBoth works pave the way to the modelling of the interaction networks and high-accuracy simulation of cells in 3D; something that can be now more easily done, as highlighted by the third paper, Building structural models of a whole mycoplasma cell. In this work, the authors used experimental and homology-modelled macromolecular structures and lattice-based models of a genome to generate the first 3D whole cell model of a eukaryote, Mycoplasma genitalium.\nIf we thought one year ago that the structural biology field was changed forever due to the onset of deep learning, advancements in computer graphics and whole cell simulations together with this boosting revolution will definitely change the way we study (molecular) biology.\nMining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome Using their previously developed predictor of antimicrobial efficacy for antimicrobial peptides (AMP), the authors of this paper identified 2603 AMPs encoded in the human proteome. A selection of 55 representative peptides show the capability to not only kill bacteria by targeting their membrane, they also do not readily select for antibiotic resistance and show anti-infective activity in mouse models. It is quite astonishing that a search algorithm based only on 3(!) physicochemical properties (net charge, hydrophobicity and length) was enough to find new promising candidates which were shown to be viable antibiotics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post about it too.\nIterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Antibody Sequence-Structure Co-design A fascinating protein design task, namely the joint design of an antibody sequence and 3D structure. The authors formulate this as a graph-generation problem and combine autoregressive models with iterative refinement to generate a full graph with node labels, edge labels and coordinates. In each generation step, the model learns to revise a current antibody graph and predict the label of the next residue. There\u0026rsquo;s one message passing network to predict the amino acid, and then another one to predict the new coordinates of all residues given the newly added amino acid. Unlike AlphaFold, this approach predicts the structure of an incomplete sequence without a specified MSA. This allows them to optimize the sequence-structure combo according to specific requirements. For instance, one of the validation experiments aims to identify neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 with sequence constraints such as low net charge, no glycosylation motifs, and no repeating stretches of amino acids. This level of control could be very useful for other protein design tasks as well.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 2. 3D-WC-MG recipe.

Short answer: No. Most of the predicted structures are in the holo or ligand-bound form, and predictions get worse when your protein is already conformationally diverse, probably because the evolutionary signal becomes fuzzy. Not all bad though - predicting holo forms is arguably more exciting than apo, and plDDT could be sensitive enough to detect different kinds of protein flexibility.\nThe case for post-predictional modifications in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Great news - since AlphaFold was trained using inter-residue distances from proteins in the PDB, it learned to leave space for co-factors and post-translational modifications. The authors graft glycans on a model and explain how other kinds of modifications could be added in as well. This is definitely a call to action:\n \u0026hellip; these early results are highly encouraging to serve as a rallying point for the developers‚Äô community to complete and enrich the predicted protein models with likely modifications, to bring them to their fullest potential and to correctly inform the next generation of structural biology studies.\u0026quot;\n Artificial intelligence reveals nuclear pore complexity A Herculean feat - combining cryo-ET, cryo-EM, de novo structure and interface prediction, and coarse molecular dynamics to model the gigantic human nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold.

The one that didn\u0026rsquo;t fit was remodelled and refined using RoseTTAfold and AlphaFold fragments. Information from the cryo-ET map was used to set up the MD simulation, which in turn matched previous experimental data about NPC constriction.\nApplications of AlphaFold beyond Protein Structure Prediction An interesting grab-bag of strategies, ideas, and preliminary experiments, ranging from mutational stability prediction to protein design. One of the first papers using the intermediate representations returned by AlphaFold instead of just the structure. These are essentially features per residue, and predict point mutation stability change pretty well.\nPre-training Co-evolutionary Protein Representation via A Pairwise Masked Language Model Using pairwise information while pre-training protein sequences makes the learned sequence representations much better at contact prediction.\nMultiple rereads of single proteins at single‚Äìamino acid resolution using nanopores And finally, something a little tangential and further off, Nanopore sequencing is coming to proteins!
