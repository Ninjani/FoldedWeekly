[{"content":"Fundamental behaviors emerge from simulations of a living minimal cell Can we simulate a full living cell with all its chemicals while taking into account spatial heterogeneity? The authors describe a significant step in that direction by simulating a living minimal cell (JCVI-syn3A) with over 7000 reactions governing the evolution of its metabolites, proteins, mRNAs, tRNAs, DNA and ribosomes. A coarse grained spatially resolved model (at 4 nm resolution) was initialised based on cryo-ET images providing the cell morphology and the location of the ribosomes while other macromolecules were added to it. Simulations were run with a hybrid stochastic and deterministic setup both on the spatially resolved model and on a simpler well stirred model without spatial heterogeneity. The latter was necessary as the computational cost for the spatial model was too high and growth of the cell could not properly be accounted for yet. Future work should address these limitations, but the current model was already able to showcase interesting emerging behaviours which fit well with experimental observations while providing additional time-resolved details. For instance, the authors could measure distributions of mRNA half-lives and protein production, when and where ATP was used, connections between metabolism and cell growth, and DNA replication events.\nPetabase-scale sequence alignment catalyses viral discovery The authors perform a high throughput alignment-based sequence search across over 10 petabytes of sequence read data with the purpose of identifying new RNA viruses. Their approach has a higher sensitivity than k-mer index approaches, while being much faster than de novo assembly approaches. The viral search is underpinned by a \u0026ldquo;palmprint\u0026rdquo; - a set of three essential motifs in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which form its catalytic core. Novel palmprints identified across the huge database increased the number of known RNA viruses nearly ten-fold. The authors then focus on three relevant viral families - Coronoviridae (of SARS-CoV-2 fame), delta virus (such as the one causing viral hepatitis), and huge phages from microbiome research. The polished and comprehensive Serratus website provides access to all these analyses and the raw data. You can even find matches for your own virus of interest.\nCellular homologs of the double jelly-roll major capsid proteins clarify the origins of an ancient virus kingdom Viruses are a distinct group of biological entitites and their origin is a hotly debated problem. While most core components of most viral lineages seem to precede the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), there are indications that, within various structural components, different capsid proteins may have evolved from the recruitment of diverse cellular proteins, especially those involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates. In this study, the authors investigate the origins of the major capsid protein of a broad variety of double-stranded DNA viruses, a protein long thought to represent a viral innovation. Using protein structure comparison, they traced this protein family to a bacterial cellular ancestor likely involved in carbohydrate metabolism, rephrasing the history of these viruses while reinforcing the chimeric view on virus origins.\nFigure of the Week   Source: Towards Controllable Protein design with Conditional Transformers\nSome more  AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery: Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small Molecule Inhibitor Proteome-scale mapping of binding sites in the unstructured regions of the human proteome Fragment Hotspot Mapping to Identify Selectivity-Determining Regions between Related Proteins The computational models of AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold carry protein foldability information Design in the DARK: Learning Deep Generative Models for De Novo Protein Design Enhancing protein inter-residue real distance prediction by scrutinising deep learning models Label-free visual proteomics: Coupling MS- and EM-based approaches in structural biology Towards Controllable Protein design with Conditional Transformers Lira: Rotational Invariant Shape and Electrostatic Descriptors for Small Molecules and Protein Pockets based on Real Spherical Harmonics ATLIGATOR: Editing protein interactions with an atlas-based approach The AlphaFold Database now has over a million structures  On Neglected Tropical Disease Day, we teamed up with @DeepMind to publish 190,000+ relevant protein structure predictions in the #AlphaFold database – freely available to all! #WorldNTDDay #beatNTDhttps://t.co/Mvq4cC2ilI pic.twitter.com/IRUXwq6pVg\n\u0026mdash; EMBL-EBI (@emblebi) January 28, 2022  ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/11/","summary":"This week we look at a fully simulated living cell and explore viruses","title":"Issue 11"},{"content":"Quantifying structural relationships of metal-binding sites suggests origins of biological electron transfer Motivated by how crucial redox reactions are for life, the authors take a look at how early in molecular evolution catalysis of such reactions has emerged. They found a couple of small motifs, binding metals or metal-associated ligands, of similar geometry and sequence used across all proteins. That may be seen as indicator that peptides with redox functionality could have existed before first proteins. At the core of the study, a new structure-annotated homology, ligand-extended (sahle) score is used to calculate a distance between structural fragments. After reducing fragment space to representatives, the distance network is transformed into a minimum spanning tree (MSP) and enriched with genomic data to get phylogeny attached to the fragments. This leads to a small set of central motifs which serve as origin for the rest of the MSP. Verifying their central motifs with other studies leads the authors to the assumption that peptides carrying those motifs may have existed more than 3.8 billion years ago.\nFolding the unfoldable: Using AlphaFold to explore spurious proteins  The authors apply AlphaFold2 to AntiFam, which contains 250 sequence profiles annotated as \u0026ldquo;spurious\u0026rdquo; proteins, either because they are believed to be spurious translations, they overlap with known non-coding RNA genes, or because they are found on the opposite strand of known genes. Their first result is that there is a strong correlation between the mean plDDT and the length of the sequence, with shorter sequences showing higher mean plDDT both with the AntiFam sequences and with randomly generated amino acid sequences. But, ignoring sequences \u0026lt;100 residues, the mean plDDT scores are higher for SwissProt proteins compared to AntiFam spurious proteins. This proved false for only one AntiFam entry, and on closer inspection it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of evidence for this entry representing real functional proteins - so the authors deposited this entry back into Pfam. Overall a nice analysis showing that AlphaFold2 can provide an additional quality control estimate for spurious protein profiles, with the caveat that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used for short sequence lengths.\nCan AlphaFold2 predict the impact of missense mutations on structure? No, it can not. The authors show three examples in which AlphaFold2 fails in predicting the ‘structure-disrupted’ protein successfully. This is not that surprising considering the fact that AlphaFold is trained mostly on wild type structures and it is supposed to be resistant to noise. However they offer an interesting showcase analyzing those examples in detail.\nFigure of the Week    Fig. 1. Cryo-EM structure of the Omicron spike protein.

In this review, the authors discuss the most recent computational advancements that complement established biophysical methods in the characterization of protein-protein interactions. From the use of the massive amount of genomic data now available, to the application of co-evolution analyses and the advent of highly accurate protein structure prediction methods based on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, this review is a concise but extremely rich overview of the current state of the computational contributions to the field. It shows how more and more intermingled different disciplines are becoming in the field, and how that interdisciplinarity is taking us at warp speed closer to the modelling of large protein-protein interaction networks that explain key biological processes.\nHarnessing protein folding neural networks for peptide–protein docking The authors tackle protein-peptide complexes with AlphaFold2, by attaching the peptide sequence to the protein sequence with a long polyglycine linker. They obtain impressive results on a small set and slightly worse but still inspiring results on a larget set, all without the need for the elusive peptide MSA. AF2 performed best on complexes with peptide-binding motifs and in fact pLDDT scores could be used as a motif discovery tool. One curious result that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before is that AF2 always models the bound conformation, even if the interaction involves PTMs and ligands and even if only the free receptor is given as input, indicating some memorization of bound complexes without the underlying biophysics. All in all, PFPD (the main competitor in this paper) looks for a bound conformation of the peptide in solved monomer structures and then docks it with the protein, while AF2 assumes that peptide binding is just another step in the protein folding process. Since these produced complementary results, the future could hold adaptive methods that combine the two concepts for even more accurate protein-peptide complex modelling.\nEarly Computational Detection of Potential High Risk SARS-CoV-2 Variants Harmless mutation or the next big threat? The authors aim to implement an early warning system (EWS) combining structural modelling with AI to detect and monitor high risk SARS-CoV-2 variants. Already Hie et al. (PMID: 33446556) modelled the ability for viruses to mutate and evade the human immune system using natural language processing models. This has been lifted to a whole new level and complemented by predicted binding affinities of Spike to human ACE2 and other priors. Guess what? Omicron shined up brightly from day one. We would appreciate more specifics from the authors though. In particular, binding affinity calculations lack the details required for reproducibility.\nFigure of the Week    Fig. 2: Series of energy landscapes for the hemagglutinin fusion peptide membrane insertion simulated by molecular dynamics.

The schematic shows how a non-equilibrium process (insertion into a membrane) can be approximated by a trajectory involving a series of energy landscapes.

This library, typically filtered based on the ligand of interest, ligand size, or sequence identity to the protein of interest, serves as a search database for finding pockets in a query protein, with the filtering reducing the search time down from days to hours. The search itself depends on a structure alignment of the sphere to the entire query protein, returning multiple detected pockets and improving upon pocket detection performance state-of-the-art even at low sequence identities. Surprisingly, side-chain conformations do not improve performance. In another experiment, the authors also show that binding affinity is similar across similar pockets.\nImproving AlphaFold modeling using implicit information from experimental density maps In this paper the authors bring AlphaFold into the integrative modelling and iterative model building realms, proposing a new approach for protein model building starting from its sequence and experimental cryo-EM map. From an initial AlphaFold2 model, the authors propose an iterative approach where that model is fit into the density, remodelled based on it, and fed back as a template for another round of AlphaFold2 structure prediction. They applied the approach to the modelling of 25 cryo-EM structures and, in most cases, the procedure allowed for the building of models at a better accuracy than the initial AlphaFold model. While here they combine AlphaFold models with cryo-EM map interpretation, the approach is general and can be extended to any other protein structure prediction method and map-based biophysical approach, thus paving the way to the development of further synergic methods for better modelling of protein structures at atomic level of accuracy.\nAlphaFold2-aware protein-DNA binding site prediction using graph transformer The authors present GraphSite, a graph-based predictor of DNA binding sites at a residue level. This tool is based on a graph representation of the protein in which the residues are the nodes, and uses a transformer architecture to classify them. The nodes features are generated using both multiple sequence alignment and structural information. To do so, they predict the structure with AlphaFold-2 and extract the intermediate representation generated by the network. Moreover, they extract several structural properties from the predicted model such as backbone angles and accessible surface area. This method offers very good classification performances compared both to the sequence-based and structure-based state-of-the-art methods. Unsurprisingly, predicted structure quality can greatly affect performance. The authors also mention an interesting possible extension of their approach: adding edge features encoding residue distance or AlphaFold2 intermediate pair representations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1.

Given a query ligand and target protein, ComBind finds other distinct ligands binding to that protein, docks all of them, and then picks poses for each ligand optimizing a potential shared across all the ligands, i.e. one that rewards protein-ligand interactions shared across different ligands. The same potentials are also used as a proxy for relative binding affinities, perfect for virtual screening. Quite a nice discussion comparing this to previous work and on integrating this concept with future improvements in docking and virtual screening.\nPredictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning The emergence of SARS-CoV 2 variants with multiple, combined mutations rises the concern that the virus may fall into an evolutionary path that promotes the escaping of multiple classes of neutralizing antibodies. In this paper, the authors combined yeast display with deep sequencing to interrogate a massive sequence space of combinatorial mutations, representing billions of variants of the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. This allowed them to generate a large, experimental labelled dataset of sequences that could then be used to train two machine learning models (a random forest and a long-short-term-memory recurrent neural network) that predict, at very high accuracy, whether a given variant would interact with the ACE2 enzyme and, if so, would escape four commercial neutralizing antibodies. The models may enable researchers to select candidate antibody therapeutics and could be used as a de facto monitoring system, helping researchers to prospectively identify future variants with the highest likelihood of emergence.\nConformational variation in enzyme catalysis: A structural study on catalytic residues A very thorough analysis of the flexibility of catalytic residues from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas across over 900 enzyme families and across the entire PDB. Some conclusions: there\u0026rsquo;s a high structural conservation of the active site across enzymes from the same family almost regardless of the sequence similarity; most active sites exhibit some degree of flexibility, half of which is accounted for by only side chain motion; the highest RMSD variability is observed when comparing ligand-free and ligand-bound active sites; \u0026ldquo;reactant\u0026rdquo; residues (proton donor, acceptor, and shuttle) are more rigid than \u0026ldquo;spectator\u0026rdquo; (electrostatic stabiliser, activator, steric role) residues; and, based on their RMSD distributions, active sites can be broadly divided into inherently rigid, inherently flexible, open/closed, and extensively variable. Look out for their CSA-3D Python library which will help generalize analyses on catalytic sites like this one.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1. Overview of deep mutational learning of the RBD for prediction of ACE2 binding and antibody escape. The RBD or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is expressed on the surface of yeast, mutagenesis libraries are designed on the receptor-binding motif (RBM-2) of the RBD, which are the sites of interaction with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies (e.g., therapeutic antibody drugs). RBD libraries are screened by FACS for binding to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, both binding and non-binding (escape) populations are isolated and subjected to deep sequencing. Machine learning models are trained to predict binding status to ACE2 or antibodies based on RBD sequence. Machine learning models are then used to predict ACE2 binding and antibody escape on current and prospective variants and lineages.\n Source: Predictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning\nSome more  SARS-CoV-2 variants impact RBD conformational dynamics and ACE2 accessibility Synthon-based ligand discovery in virtual libraries of over 11 billion compounds Learning physics confers pose-sensitivity in structure-based virtual screening InDeep: 3D fully convolutional neural networks to assist in silico drug design on protein-protein interactions A novel sequence-based predictor for identifying and characterizing thermophilic proteins using estimated propensity scores of dipeptides Constructing synthetic-protein assemblies from de novo designed 310 helices Version 3 of Improved prediction of protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold2  \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;In short two major things have changed 1) We have introduced a pDockQ score that predicts the DockQ score for each protein-protein interactions.

After the convolution, the graph readout is performed with a very interesting graph pooling method based on self-attention: Set2Set. The network was trained on a dataset generated by the authors - they divided pockets into 14 different classes by clustering them according to the Tanimoto coefficient of the corresponding ligand. They validated the method by randomly splitting the dataset into a training and a testing set multiple times and averaging the obtained accuracies. Overall, they obtained a good prediction accuracy, but it would be interesting to observe the tool performances on an ‘external’ dataset.\nModeling Alternate Conformations with Alphafold2 via Modification of the Multiple Sequence Alignment Yet another approach to coerce different conformations from AlphaFold2. We\u0026rsquo;ve covered two others just in the past two weeks. Even Deepmind ran into this for an elusive multi-drug transporter (LmrP) where vanilla AF2 only yielded one conformation - they pared the MSA and templates to only include structures with the other conformation and submitted the alternate conformations produced to CASP14. This paper builds on this idea in a novel way and gives us a neat procedure that can be more generally applied - make an AF2 model, pinpoint possible contact points (either from examining other crystal structures, prior knowledge from mutation studies, or just picking residues connecting two domains), then in-silico mutate the entire MSA at the chosen positions to alanine so that the attention network inside AF2, which depends on co-evolutionary signal, is forced to look elsewhere.\nNavigating Chemical Space by Interfacing Generative Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Docking A protein structure-aware molecular library preparation approach! A generative variational autoencoder is trained on molecular structures to obtain a latent space. Starting from an initial library, each reference molecule is embedded into this pretrained latent space and new molecules are selected from the neighborhood. These new molecules are docked to a target protein and those with the highest predicted binding affinity are chosen as the new set of reference molecules, and the process continues to narrow down the library to high affinity binders. There\u0026rsquo;s interactive TMAP plots covering some of their example runs - a really nice way of visualizing the greedy algorithm\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 8.

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the structural properties of the complex using atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics. They observe that variants of concern tend to stabilize the RBD-ACE2 complex. The mutations N501Y (α, β, and γ strain) and E484Q (κ strain) particularly increase complex stability. N501Y is also shown to not affect antibody neutralization in a significant way. This analysis workflow might be generally applicable for the analysis of the impact of future viral mutations on infection-induced immunity.\nMulti-State Modeling of G-protein Coupled Receptors at Experimental Accuracy The authors observed the propensity of AlphaFold to model the inactive conformation of the members of the GPCR family. Presumably, this happens because of training based on the PDB where inactive state GPCR structures are overrepresented. However, they could successfully model the active state of the structures by using as input only templates from state-annotated GPCR databases and, surprisingly, avoiding the use of MSA input features. This work shows how it is possible to induce AlphaFold to model a specific conformation of a structure as long as experimental structures in multiple states are available to form state-specific template databases.\nAlphaFill: enriching the AlphaFold models with ligands and co-factors Already at the time of the CASP experiment, it was noted that even without the knowledge about ligands, especially metals, AlphaFold was able to accurately predict the right side chain orientation of ligand binding sites. Now that more than 300,000 structural models across 21 proteomes are available, that becomes even more evident, with AlphaFold predicting confidently even the structure of those proteins that require smaller molecules for folding. Missing from the models, however, are those ligands; AlphaFold does not predict (let\u0026rsquo;s say, yet) ligands. What AlphaFill provide is a glimpse into those ligands. By looking for close homologs of known structure with a ligand bound, the AlphaFill service (available as a database), \u0026ldquo;fills\u0026rdquo; the ligand-binding sites of AlphaFold models with those from the homologs. Neat and simple, the AlphaFill database provides a quite unique and super informative look into the structural coverage provided by the AlphaFold database.\nFigure of the Week    Fig 4.

In this paper, the authors ask how the two pillars of coevolutionary analysis contribute to the inference of interaction - these are the phylogenetic correlation (often seen as a confounder and corrected for in direct coupling analysis), and the correlation of structural contacts. Using synthetic data combining different levels of phylogenetic and structural constraints, the authors discover that both contribute to the performance of interaction prediction, and that the presence of one may compensate for the absence of the other - e.g phylogenetically correlated non-contacting sites help when there\u0026rsquo;s fewer structurally contacting sites. Seems like an adaptive approach that uses phylogeny when proteins are closely related, and corrects for it otherwise might be a future direction to explore.\nVIVID: a web application for variant interpretation and visualisation in multidimensional analyses The authors created a useful tool which allows the user to go from called variants to the corresponding AlphaFold2 models in one go.

Afterwards, they used available tools to predict ligand binding sites, protein-protein interfaces and conserved regions in the models with high confidence scores. Finally, they checked whether the disease-associated mutations of the modeled proteins are in proximity of the predicted functional sites, or if they are destabilizing for the protein according to FoldX.

Various models and experimental structures of protomers and oligomers in SARS-CoV-2 are presented together with a prediction of substrate and allosteric binding sites, protein-ligand docking, SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with human proteins and impacts of mutations on stability mapped to their respective structures.\nTwo-input protein logic gate for computation in living cells The authors design a \u0026ldquo;nano-computing agent\u0026rdquo;, a protein kinase that functions as a 2-bit logic OR gate. The first input, rapamycin, activates kinase activity and the second input, blue light, inactivates kinase activity. Analogous to hardware engineering complexities, inactivation wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fast as activation because of biological reasons. Similar setups could be applied to different kinds of proteins, giving us an arsenal of controllable protein agents for use in biomedicine and biotech.\nToward More General Embeddings for Protein Design: Harnessing Joint Representations of Sequence and Structure In Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, a transformer was trained on a huge dataset of sequences to embed proteins into a biologically meaningful learned embedding space. Here, the authors use this pre-trained model to generate sequence features, combine them with a graph representation of structures, and train a rotation and translation equivariant transformer to generate an embedding. This embedding performs better at mutation thermostability prediction likely because it\u0026rsquo;s able to take into account sequentially-distant structurally-close influences. Of course this structural information can come from computationally predicted structures as well, following the trend in this post-AlphaFold era of replacing or augmenting sequence-based approaches with structure.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1: Summary of the workflow, landscapes, and splits. (A) General FLIP workflow: choose landscapes and splits that match user needs, train models and make predictions on the test set, and then compare to baseline models. (B) We choose landscapes that cover different types of sequence diversity. The GB1 landscape focuses on simultaneous mutation of four epistatic sites with nearly complete coverage [41] (PDB ID: 2GI9 [42]). The AAV capsid protein landscape sparsely samples sequences with up to 28 mutations, including insertions and deletions, to the the binding interface [43] (PDB ID: 6IH9 [44]). The thermostability landscape [45] measures a property shared by proteins from multiple functional groups across different domains of life. (C). We also provide up to seven suggested data splits for each landscape, which are described in Section 3.\n Source: FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins\nSome more  Computational design of nanoscale rotational mechanics in de novo protein assemblies Science Forum: Nanoscape, a data-driven 3D real-time interactive virtual cell environment FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins Deep learning methods for designing proteins scaffolding functional sites ParaFold: Paralleling AlphaFold for Large-Scale Predictions #COVIDisAirborne: AI-Enabled Multiscale Computational Microscopy of Delta SARS-CoV-2 in a Respiratory Aerosol Computational Structural Genomics Unravels Common Folds and Novel Families in the Secretome of Fungal Phytopathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Contrastive learning on protein embeddings enlightens midnight zone at lightning speed Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins  ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/3/","summary":"This week there\u0026rsquo;s SARS-CoV-2 structures, protein computing agents, and sequence-structure embeddings.","title":"Issue 3"},{"content":"A bundle of protein interactomes This week, three different papers addressing the 3-dimensional modelling of protein interactions at the cellular level were released, all paving the way to the automated and high-accuracy modelling of entire cells in 3D. The first, Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes, addresses the problem of predicting the composition and accurately modelling the 3D structure of protein macromolecular assemblies at the same time. The combination of RoseTTAFold for pair prediction with AlphaFold2 for structure modelling allowed for the construction of more than 1000 protein-protein assemblies from baker’s yeast. This not only included previously known interactions, but also more than 100 unknown others that may highlight previously unknown functions.\nIn the second paper, Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network, the authors use AlphaFold2 to model the 3-dimensional structure of more than 60’000 previously known protein interactions in the human proteome, providing building blocks to the construction of larger assemblies.\nBoth works pave the way to the modelling of the interaction networks and high-accuracy simulation of cells in 3D; something that can be now more easily done, as highlighted by the third paper, Building structural models of a whole mycoplasma cell. In this work, the authors used experimental and homology-modelled macromolecular structures and lattice-based models of a genome to generate the first 3D whole cell model of a eukaryote, Mycoplasma genitalium.\nIf we thought one year ago that the structural biology field was changed forever due to the onset of deep learning, advancements in computer graphics and whole cell simulations together with this boosting revolution will definitely change the way we study (molecular) biology.\nMining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome Using their previously developed predictor of antimicrobial efficacy for antimicrobial peptides (AMP), the authors of this paper identified 2603 AMPs encoded in the human proteome. A selection of 55 representative peptides show the capability to not only kill bacteria by targeting their membrane, they also do not readily select for antibiotic resistance and show anti-infective activity in mouse models. It is quite astonishing that a search algorithm based only on 3(!) physicochemical properties (net charge, hydrophobicity and length) was enough to find new promising candidates which were shown to be viable antibiotics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post about it too.\nIterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Antibody Sequence-Structure Co-design A fascinating protein design task, namely the joint design of an antibody sequence and 3D structure. The authors formulate this as a graph-generation problem and combine autoregressive models with iterative refinement to generate a full graph with node labels, edge labels and coordinates. In each generation step, the model learns to revise a current antibody graph and predict the label of the next residue. There\u0026rsquo;s one message passing network to predict the amino acid, and then another one to predict the new coordinates of all residues given the newly added amino acid. Unlike AlphaFold, this approach predicts the structure of an incomplete sequence without a specified MSA. This allows them to optimize the sequence-structure combo according to specific requirements. For instance, one of the validation experiments aims to identify neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 with sequence constraints such as low net charge, no glycosylation motifs, and no repeating stretches of amino acids. This level of control could be very useful for other protein design tasks as well.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 2. 3D-WC-MG recipe.

Short answer: No. Most of the predicted structures are in the holo or ligand-bound form, and predictions get worse when your protein is already conformationally diverse, probably because the evolutionary signal becomes fuzzy. Not all bad though - predicting holo forms is arguably more exciting than apo, and plDDT could be sensitive enough to detect different kinds of protein flexibility.\nThe case for post-predictional modifications in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Great news - since AlphaFold was trained using inter-residue distances from proteins in the PDB, it learned to leave space for co-factors and post-translational modifications. The authors graft glycans on a model and explain how other kinds of modifications could be added in as well. This is definitely a call to action:\n \u0026hellip; these early results are highly encouraging to serve as a rallying point for the developers’ community to complete and enrich the predicted protein models with likely modifications, to bring them to their fullest potential and to correctly inform the next generation of structural biology studies.\u0026quot;\n Artificial intelligence reveals nuclear pore complexity A Herculean feat - combining cryo-ET, cryo-EM, de novo structure and interface prediction, and coarse molecular dynamics to model the gigantic human nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold. There\u0026rsquo;s even a video\nWe combined #AlphaFold and #cryoEM to build a new model of the nuclear pore complex, the largest complex in the human cell! The structure covered by the model is 15x bigger than the human ribosome and 2x bigger than old nuclear pore models. 1/7\nRead how: https://t.co/mCLg0hEQFr pic.twitter.com/YpUvonwVT7\n\u0026mdash; Jan Kosinski (@jankosinski) October 28, 2021  Overall a great demonstration of integrative structural biology with each step backed up by different technologies - predicted monomeric and complex structures were validated with new X-ray structures and fit to EM maps. The one that didn\u0026rsquo;t fit was remodelled and refined using RoseTTAfold and AlphaFold fragments. Information from the cryo-ET map was used to set up the MD simulation, which in turn matched previous experimental data about NPC constriction.\nApplications of AlphaFold beyond Protein Structure Prediction An interesting grab-bag of strategies, ideas, and preliminary experiments, ranging from mutational stability prediction to protein design. One of the first papers using the intermediate representations returned by AlphaFold instead of just the structure. These are essentially features per residue, and predict point mutation stability change pretty well.\nPre-training Co-evolutionary Protein Representation via A Pairwise Masked Language Model Using pairwise information while pre-training protein sequences makes the learned sequence representations much better at contact prediction.\nMultiple rereads of single proteins at single–amino acid resolution using nanopores And finally, something a little tangential and further off, Nanopore sequencing is coming to proteins! All these advancements move us ever closer to the futuristic sci-fi handheld device that you point at a sample in the field and instantly get a screen (holographic of course) of all the (PTM-ed) proteins and their (predicted) structures.\n","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/posts/1/","summary":"This week we look at conformational diversity, post-translational modifications,\nintegrative structural modelling, pre-training protein sequences, and sequencing proteins.","title":"Issue 1"},{"content":"Pymol script draw_protein.py\nfrom pymol import cmd import sys _, pdb_id, issue = sys.argv cmd.fetch(pdb_id) cmd.bg_color(\u0026#34;white\u0026#34;) cmd.remove(\u0026#34;solvent\u0026#34;) cmd.zoom() cmd.orient() cmd.set(\u0026#34;cartoon_fancy_helices\u0026#34;, 1) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ambient\u0026#34;, 0.5) cmd.set(\u0026#34;antialias\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;cartoon_sampling\u0026#34;, 30) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_mode\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_color\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0x775abf\u0026#34;) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_opaque_background\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;off\u0026#34;) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_gain\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_disco_factor\u0026#34;, 1.) cmd.ray(2000) filename = f\u0026#34;{issue}_pymol.png\u0026#34; cmd.png(str(filename), width=2000, height=2000, dpi=300) cmd.quit() Cropping Uses ImageMagick and smartcrop\n./make_post_image \u0026lt;pdb_id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;issue_num\u0026gt;\npymol -cq draw_protein.py -- $1 $2 convert $2_pymol.png -trim +repage $2.png ./smartcrop -w 1500 -h 300 -s pyramid $2.png $2.png mv $2.png FoldedWeekly/static/img PDB IDs    Issue PDB ID     1 7lc2   2 7rxv   3 7rwz   4 7dit   5 7r6z   6 7ptx   7 7p12   8 7dsd   9 7nma   10 7dbh   11 4rlc    ","permalink":"https://folded-weekly.netlify.app/headers/","summary":"Pymol script draw_protein.py\nfrom pymol import cmd import sys _, pdb_id, issue = sys.argv cmd.fetch(pdb_id) cmd.bg_color(\u0026#34;white\u0026#34;) cmd.remove(\u0026#34;solvent\u0026#34;) cmd.zoom() cmd.orient() cmd.set(\u0026#34;cartoon_fancy_helices\u0026#34;, 1) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ambient\u0026#34;, 0.5) cmd.set(\u0026#34;antialias\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;cartoon_sampling\u0026#34;, 30) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_mode\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_color\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0x775abf\u0026#34;) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_opaque_background\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;off\u0026#34;) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_gain\u0026#34;, 2) cmd.set(\u0026#34;ray_trace_disco_factor\u0026#34;, 1.) cmd.ray(2000) filename = f\u0026#34;{issue}_pymol.png\u0026#34; cmd.png(str(filename), width=2000, height=2000, dpi=300) cmd.quit() Cropping Uses ImageMagick and smartcrop\n./make_post_image \u0026lt;pdb_id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;issue_num\u0026gt;\npymol -cq draw_protein.py -- $1 $2 convert $2_pymol.png -trim +repage $2.png ./smartcrop -w 1500 -h 300 -s pyramid $2.","title":""}]
