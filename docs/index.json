[{"content":"A bundle of protein interactomes This week, three different papers addressing the 3-dimensional modelling of protein interactions at the cellular level were released, all paving the way to the automated and high-accuracy modelling of entire cells in 3D. The first, Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes, addresses the problem of predicting the composition and accurately modelling the 3D structure of protein macromolecular assemblies at the same time. The combination of RoseTTAFold for pair prediction with AlphaFold2 for structure modelling allowed for the construction of more than 1000 protein-protein assemblies from baker’s yeast. This not only included previously known interactions, but also more than 100 unknown others that may highlight previously unknown functions.\nIn the second paper, Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network, the authors use AlphaFold2 to model the 3-dimensional structure of more than 60’000 previously known protein interactions in the human proteome, providing building blocks to the construction of larger assemblies.\nBoth works pave the way to the modelling of the interaction networks and high-accuracy simulation of cells in 3D; something that can be now more easily done, as highlighted by the third paper, Building structural models of a whole mycoplasma cell. In this work, the authors used experimental and homology-modelled macromolecular structures and lattice-based models of a genome to generate the first 3D whole cell model of a eukaryote, Mycoplasma genitalium.\nIf we thought one year ago that the structural biology field was changed forever due to the onset of deep learning, advancements in computer graphics and whole cell simulations together with this boosting revolution will definitely change the way we study (molecular) biology.\nMining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome Using their previously developed predictor of antimicrobial efficacy for antimicrobial peptides (AMP), the authors of this paper identified 2603 AMPs encoded in the human proteome. A selection of 55 representative peptides show the capability to not only kill bacteria by targeting their membrane, they also do not readily select for antibiotic resistance and show anti-infective activity in mouse models. It is quite astonishing that a search algorithm based only on 3(!) physicochemical properties (net charge, hydrophobicity and length) was enough to find new promising candidates which were shown to be viable antibiotics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post about it too.\nIterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Antibody Sequence-Structure Co-design A fascinating protein design task, namely the joint design of an antibody sequence and 3D structure. The authors formulate this as a graph-generation problem and combine autoregressive models with iterative refinement to generate a full graph with node labels, edge labels and coordinates. In each generation step, the model learns to revise a current antibody graph and predict the label of the next residue. There\u0026rsquo;s one message passing network to predict the amino acid, and then another one to predict the new coordinates of all residues given the newly added amino acid. Unlike AlphaFold, this approach predicts the structure of an incomplete sequence without a specified MSA. This allows them to optimize the sequence-structure combo according to specific requirements. For instance, one of the validation experiments aims to identify neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 with sequence constraints such as low net charge, no glycosylation motifs, and no repeating stretches of amino acids. This level of control could be very useful for other protein design tasks as well.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 2. 3D-WC-MG recipe.

Short answer: No. Most of the predicted structures are in the holo or ligand-bound form, and predictions get worse when your protein is already conformationally diverse, probably because the evolutionary signal becomes fuzzy. Not all bad though - predicting holo forms is arguably more exciting than apo, and plDDT could be sensitive enough to detect different kinds of protein flexibility.\nThe case for post-predictional modifications in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Great news - since AlphaFold was trained using inter-residue distances from proteins in the PDB, it learned to leave space for co-factors and post-translational modifications. The authors graft glycans on a model and explain how other kinds of modifications could be added in as well. This is definitely a call to action:\n \u0026hellip; these early results are highly encouraging to serve as a rallying point for the developers’ community to complete and enrich the predicted protein models with likely modifications, to bring them to their fullest potential and to correctly inform the next generation of structural biology studies.\u0026quot;\n Artificial intelligence reveals nuclear pore complexity A Herculean feat - combining cryo-ET, cryo-EM, de novo structure and interface prediction, and coarse molecular dynamics to model the gigantic human nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold. There\u0026rsquo;s even a video\nhttps://twitter.com/jankosinski/status/1453530872427253765\nOverall a great demonstration of integrative structural biology with each step backed up by different technologies - predicted monomeric and complex structures were validated with new X-ray structures and fit to EM maps. The one that didn\u0026rsquo;t fit was remodelled and refined using RoseTTAfold and AlphaFold fragments. Information from the cryo-ET map was used to set up the MD simulation, which in turn matched previous experimental data about NPC constriction.\nApplications of AlphaFold beyond Protein Structure Prediction An interesting grab-bag of strategies, ideas, and preliminary experiments, ranging from mutational stability prediction to protein design. One of the first papers using the intermediate representations returned by AlphaFold instead of just the structure. These are essentially features per residue and predicted point mutation stability change pretty well.\nPre-training Co-evolutionary Protein Representation via A Pairwise Masked Language Model Using pairwise information while pre-training protein sequences makes the learned sequence representations much better at contact prediction.\nMultiple rereads of single proteins at single–amino acid resolution using nanopores And finally, something a little tangential and further off, Nanopore sequencing is coming to proteins! All these advancements move us ever closer to the futuristic sci-fi handheld device that you point at a sample in the field and instantly get a screen (holographic of course) of all the (PTM-ed) proteins and their (predicted) structures.\n","permalink":"https://ninjani.github.io/FoldedWeekly/posts/1/","summary":"This week we look at conformational diversity, post-translational modifications,\nintegrative structural modelling, pre-training protein sequences, and sequencing proteins.","title":"Issue 1"}]
