[{"content":"Leveraging nonstructural data to predict structures and affinities of protein–ligand complexes The authors use the knowledge that even dissimilar ligands tend to bind to a given target protein in similar poses to improve computational binding pose and binding affinity prediction. Given a query ligand and target protein, ComBind finds other distinct ligands binding to that protein, docks all of them, and then picks poses for each ligand optimizing a potential shared across all the ligands, i.e. one that rewards protein-ligand interactions shared across different ligands. The same potentials are also used as a proxy for relative binding affinities, perfect for virtual screening. Quite a nice discussion comparing this to previous work and on integrating this concept with future improvements in docking and virtual screening.\nPredictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning The emergence of SARS-CoV 2 variants with multiple, combined mutations rises the concern that the virus may fall into an evolutionary path that promotes the escaping of multiple classes of neutralizing antibodies. In this paper, the authors combined yeast display with deep sequencing to interrogate a massive sequence space of combinatorial mutations, representing billions of variants of the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. This allowed them to generate a large, experimental labelled dataset of sequences that could then be used to train two machine learning models (a random forest and a long-short-term-memory recurrent neural network) that predict, at very high accuracy, whether a given variant would interact with the ACE2 enzyme and, if so, would escape four commercial neutralizing antibodies. The models may enable researchers to select candidate antibody therapeutics and could be used as a de facto monitoring system, helping researchers to prospectively identify future variants with the highest likelihood of emergence.\nConformational variation in enzyme catalysis: A structural study on catalytic residues A very thorough analysis of the flexibility of catalytic residues from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas across over 900 enzyme families and across the entire PDB. Some conclusions: there\u0026rsquo;s a high structural conservation of the active site across enzymes from the same family almost regardless of the sequence similarity; most active sites exhibit some degree of flexibility, half of which is accounted for by only side chain motion; the highest RMSD variability is observed when comparing ligand-free and ligand-bound active sites; \u0026ldquo;reactant\u0026rdquo; residues (proton donor, acceptor, and shuttle) are more rigid than \u0026ldquo;spectator\u0026rdquo; (electrostatic stabiliser, activator, steric role) residues; and, based on their RMSD distributions, active sites can be broadly divided into inherently rigid, inherently flexible, open/closed, and extensively variable. Look out for their CSA-3D Python library which will help generalize analyses on catalytic sites like this one.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1. Overview of deep mutational learning of the RBD for prediction of ACE2 binding and antibody escape. The RBD or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is expressed on the surface of yeast, mutagenesis libraries are designed on the receptor-binding motif (RBM-2) of the RBD, which are the sites of interaction with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies (e.g., therapeutic antibody drugs). RBD libraries are screened by FACS for binding to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, both binding and non-binding (escape) populations are isolated and subjected to deep sequencing. Machine learning models are trained to predict binding status to ACE2 or antibodies based on RBD sequence. Machine learning models are then used to predict ACE2 binding and antibody escape on current and prospective variants and lineages.\n Source: Predictive profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants by deep mutational learning\nSome more  SARS-CoV-2 variants impact RBD conformational dynamics and ACE2 accessibility Synthon-based ligand discovery in virtual libraries of over 11 billion compounds Learning physics confers pose-sensitivity in structure-based virtual screening InDeep: 3D fully convolutional neural networks to assist in silico drug design on protein-protein interactions A novel sequence-based predictor for identifying and characterizing thermophilic proteins using estimated propensity scores of dipeptides Constructing synthetic-protein assemblies from de novo designed 310 helices Version 3 of Improved prediction of protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold2  \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;In short two major things have changed 1) We have introduced a pDockQ score that predicts the DockQ score for each protein-protein interactions.

The network takes as input a graph representing a protein pocket - the nodes represent atoms to which a few geometrical and chemical features are associated. After the convolution, the graph readout is performed with a very interesting graph pooling method based on self-attention: Set2Set. The network was trained on a dataset generated by the authors - they divided pockets into 14 different classes by clustering them according to the Tanimoto coefficient of the corresponding ligand. They validated the method by randomly splitting the dataset into a training and a testing set multiple times and averaging the obtained accuracies. Overall, they obtained a good prediction accuracy, but it would be interesting to observe the tool performances on an ‘external’ dataset.\nModeling Alternate Conformations with Alphafold2 via Modification of the Multiple Sequence Alignment Yet another approach to coerce different conformations from AlphaFold2. We\u0026rsquo;ve covered two others just in the past two weeks. Even Deepmind ran into this for an elusive multi-drug transporter (LmrP) where vanilla AF2 only yielded one conformation - they pared the MSA and templates to only include structures with the other conformation and submitted the alternate conformations produced to CASP14. This paper builds on this idea in a novel way and gives us a neat procedure that can be more generally applied - make an AF2 model, pinpoint possible contact points (either from examining other crystal structures, prior knowledge from mutation studies, or just picking residues connecting two domains), then in-silico mutate the entire MSA at the chosen positions to alanine so that the attention network inside AF2, which depends on co-evolutionary signal, is forced to look elsewhere.\nNavigating Chemical Space by Interfacing Generative Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Docking A protein structure-aware molecular library preparation approach! A generative variational autoencoder is trained on molecular structures to obtain a latent space. Starting from an initial library, each reference molecule is embedded into this pretrained latent space and new molecules are selected from the neighborhood. These new molecules are docked to a target protein and those with the highest predicted binding affinity are chosen as the new set of reference molecules, and the process continues to narrow down the library to high affinity binders. There\u0026rsquo;s interactive TMAP plots covering some of their example runs - a really nice way of visualizing the greedy algorithm\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 8.

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the structural properties of the complex using atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics. They observe that variants of concern tend to stabilize the RBD-ACE2 complex. The mutations N501Y (α, β, and γ strain) and E484Q (κ strain) particularly increase complex stability. N501Y is also shown to not affect antibody neutralization in a significant way. This analysis workflow might be generally applicable for the analysis of the impact of future viral mutations on infection-induced immunity.\nMulti-State Modeling of G-protein Coupled Receptors at Experimental Accuracy The authors observed the propensity of AlphaFold to model the inactive conformation of the members of the GPCR family. Presumably, this happens because of training based on the PDB where inactive state GPCR structures are overrepresented. However, they could successfully model the active state of the structures by using as input only templates from state-annotated GPCR databases and, surprisingly, avoiding the use of MSA input features. This work shows how it is possible to induce AlphaFold to model a specific conformation of a structure as long as experimental structures in multiple states are available to form state-specific template databases.\nAlphaFill: enriching the AlphaFold models with ligands and co-factors Already at the time of the CASP experiment, it was noted that even without the knowledge about ligands, especially metals, AlphaFold was able to accurately predict the right side chain orientation of ligand binding sites. Now that more than 300,000 structural models across 21 proteomes are available, that becomes even more evident, with AlphaFold predicting confidently even the structure of those proteins that require smaller molecules for folding. Missing from the models, however, are those ligands; AlphaFold does not predict (let\u0026rsquo;s say, yet) ligands. What AlphaFill provide is a glimpse into those ligands. By looking for close homologs of known structure with a ligand bound, the AlphaFill service (available as a database), \u0026ldquo;fills\u0026rdquo; the ligand-binding sites of AlphaFold models with those from the homologs. Neat and simple, the AlphaFill database provides a quite unique and super informative look into the structural coverage provided by the AlphaFold database.\nFigure of the Week    Fig 4. Neural network interpretation. (A) A UMAP projection of the latent space of the GB1 sequence convolutional network (CNN), as captured at the last internal layer of the network. In this latent space, similar variants are grouped together based on the transformation applied by the network to predict the functional score. Variants are colored by their true functional score, where red represents high-scoring variants and blue represents low-scoring variants. The clusters marked G1 and G2 correspond to variants with mutations at core residues near the start and end of the sequence, respectively. Cluster G3 corresponds to variants with mutations at surface interface residues. (B) Integrated gradients feature importance values for the Pab1 CNN, aggregated at each sequence position and superimposed on the protein’s three-dimensional structure. Blue represents positions with negative attributions, meaning mutations in those positions push the network to output lower scores, and red represents positions with positive attributions.

In this paper, the authors ask how the two pillars of coevolutionary analysis contribute to the inference of interaction - these are the phylogenetic correlation (often seen as a confounder and corrected for in direct coupling analysis), and the correlation of structural contacts. Using synthetic data combining different levels of phylogenetic and structural constraints, the authors discover that both contribute to the performance of interaction prediction, and that the presence of one may compensate for the absence of the other - e.g phylogenetically correlated non-contacting sites help when there\u0026rsquo;s fewer structurally contacting sites. Seems like an adaptive approach that uses phylogeny when proteins are closely related, and corrects for it otherwise might be a future direction to explore.\nVIVID: a web application for variant interpretation and visualisation in multidimensional analyses The authors created a useful tool which allows the user to go from called variants to the corresponding AlphaFold2 models in one go. Besides the mapping of variants from any organism or disease onto protein structures and their respective contact maps, you also get an analysis of the stability change with DynaMut2 and the changed interactions between mutated residue and environment with the Arpeggio tool. All this is combined in an easy-to-use web page which allows to download multiple results which can be used for further analysis downstream in other programs.\nCharacterizing disease-associated human proteins without available protein structures or homologues The authors of the paper took advantage of the most recent deep learning techniques (AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold) to model human disease-associated proteins. Afterwards, they used available tools to predict ligand binding sites, protein-protein interfaces and conserved regions in the models with high confidence scores. Finally, they checked whether the disease-associated mutations of the modeled proteins are in proximity of the predicted functional sites, or if they are destabilizing for the protein according to FoldX. In this way they were able to provide some rationale for most of the mutations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1. Pipeline of DomBpred.

Analogous to hardware engineering complexities, inactivation wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fast as activation because of biological reasons. Similar setups could be applied to different kinds of proteins, giving us an arsenal of controllable protein agents for use in biomedicine and biotech.\nToward More General Embeddings for Protein Design: Harnessing Joint Representations of Sequence and Structure In Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, a transformer was trained on a huge dataset of sequences to embed proteins into a biologically meaningful learned embedding space. Here, the authors use this pre-trained model to generate sequence features, combine them with a graph representation of structures, and train a rotation and translation equivariant transformer to generate an embedding. This embedding performs better at mutation thermostability prediction likely because it\u0026rsquo;s able to take into account sequentially-distant structurally-close influences. Of course this structural information can come from computationally predicted structures as well, following the trend in this post-AlphaFold era of replacing or augmenting sequence-based approaches with structure.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1: Summary of the workflow, landscapes, and splits. (A) General FLIP workflow: choose landscapes and splits that match user needs, train models and make predictions on the test set, and then compare to baseline models. (B) We choose landscapes that cover different types of sequence diversity.

The AAV capsid protein landscape sparsely samples sequences with up to 28 mutations, including insertions and deletions, to the the binding interface [43] (PDB ID: 6IH9 [44]). The thermostability landscape [45] measures a property shared by proteins from multiple functional groups across different domains of life. (C).

The first, Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes, addresses the problem of predicting the composition and accurately modelling the 3D structure of protein macromolecular assemblies at the same time. The combination of RoseTTAFold for pair prediction with AlphaFold2 for structure modelling allowed for the construction of more than 1000 protein-protein assemblies from baker’s yeast. This not only included previously known interactions, but also more than 100 unknown others that may highlight previously unknown functions.\nIn the second paper, Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network, the authors use AlphaFold2 to model the 3-dimensional structure of more than 60’000 previously known protein interactions in the human proteome, providing building blocks to the construction of larger assemblies.\nBoth works pave the way to the modelling of the interaction networks and high-accuracy simulation of cells in 3D; something that can be now more easily done, as highlighted by the third paper, Building structural models of a whole mycoplasma cell. In this work, the authors used experimental and homology-modelled macromolecular structures and lattice-based models of a genome to generate the first 3D whole cell model of a eukaryote, Mycoplasma genitalium.\nIf we thought one year ago that the structural biology field was changed forever due to the onset of deep learning, advancements in computer graphics and whole cell simulations together with this boosting revolution will definitely change the way we study (molecular) biology.\nMining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome Using their previously developed predictor of antimicrobial efficacy for antimicrobial peptides (AMP), the authors of this paper identified 2603 AMPs encoded in the human proteome. A selection of 55 representative peptides show the capability to not only kill bacteria by targeting their membrane, they also do not readily select for antibiotic resistance and show anti-infective activity in mouse models. It is quite astonishing that a search algorithm based only on 3(!) physicochemical properties (net charge, hydrophobicity and length) was enough to find new promising candidates which were shown to be viable antibiotics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post about it too.\nIterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Antibody Sequence-Structure Co-design A fascinating protein design task, namely the joint design of an antibody sequence and 3D structure. The authors formulate this as a graph-generation problem and combine autoregressive models with iterative refinement to generate a full graph with node labels, edge labels and coordinates. In each generation step, the model learns to revise a current antibody graph and predict the label of the next residue. There\u0026rsquo;s one message passing network to predict the amino acid, and then another one to predict the new coordinates of all residues given the newly added amino acid. Unlike AlphaFold, this approach predicts the structure of an incomplete sequence without a specified MSA. This allows them to optimize the sequence-structure combo according to specific requirements. For instance, one of the validation experiments aims to identify neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 with sequence constraints such as low net charge, no glycosylation motifs, and no repeating stretches of amino acids. This level of control could be very useful for other protein design tasks as well.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 2. 3D-WC-MG recipe.

Short answer: No. Most of the predicted structures are in the holo or ligand-bound form, and predictions get worse when your protein is already conformationally diverse, probably because the evolutionary signal becomes fuzzy. Not all bad though - predicting holo forms is arguably more exciting than apo, and plDDT could be sensitive enough to detect different kinds of protein flexibility.\nThe case for post-predictional modifications in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Great news - since AlphaFold was trained using inter-residue distances from proteins in the PDB, it learned to leave space for co-factors and post-translational modifications. The authors graft glycans on a model and explain how other kinds of modifications could be added in as well. This is definitely a call to action:\n \u0026hellip; these early results are highly encouraging to serve as a rallying point for the developers’ community to complete and enrich the predicted protein models with likely modifications, to bring them to their fullest potential and to correctly inform the next generation of structural biology studies.\u0026quot;\n Artificial intelligence reveals nuclear pore complexity A Herculean feat - combining cryo-ET, cryo-EM, de novo structure and interface prediction, and coarse molecular dynamics to model the gigantic human nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold.
