[{"content":"Correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively in the inference of protein partners from sequences With all the new research on the prediction of protein complexes (see Issue #2), figuring out if two proteins interact is an old problem in need of new ideas and approaches. In this paper, the authors ask how the two pillars of coevolutionary analysis contribute to the inference of interaction - these are the phylogenetic correlation (often seen as a confounder and corrected for in direct coupling analysis), and the correlation of structural contacts. Using synthetic data combining different levels of phylogenetic and structural constraints, the authors discover that both contribute to the performance of interaction prediction, and that the presence of one may compensate for the absence of the other - e.g phylogenetically correlated non-contacting sites help when there\u0026rsquo;s fewer structurally contacting sites. Seems like an adaptive approach that uses phylogeny when proteins are closely related, and corrects for it otherwise might be a future direction to explore.\nVIVID: a web application for variant interpretation and visualisation in multidimensional analyses The authors created a useful tool which allows the user to go from called variants to the corresponding AlphaFold2 models in one go. Besides the mapping of variants from any organism or disease onto protein structures and their respective contact maps, you also get an analysis of the stability change with DynaMut2 and the changed interactions between mutated residue and environment with the Arpeggio tool. All this is combined in an easy-to-use web page which allows to download multiple results which can be used for further analysis downstream in other programs.\nCharacterizing disease-associated human proteins without available protein structures or homologues The authors of the paper took advantage of the most recent deep learning techniques (AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold) to model human disease-associated proteins. Afterwards, they used available tools to predict ligand binding sites, protein-protein interfaces and conserved regions in the models with high confidence scores. Finally, they checked whether the disease-associated mutations of the modeled proteins are in proximity of the predicted functional sites, or if they are destabilizing for the protein according to FoldX. In this way they were able to provide some rationale for most of the mutations.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1. Pipeline of DomBpred.

A set of potential cut points is obtained by clustering spatially close residues in the distance map. (C) Cut points adjustment. The potential cut points are tuned based on the predicted secondary structure. (D) Domain boundary determination. The domain boundary scoring function is used to evaluate potential cut points, and the domain boundary is finally generated based on the cut points.\n Source: DomBpred: protein domain boundary predictor using inter-residue distance and domain-residue level clustering\nSome more  Characterizing Protein Conformational Spaces using Dimensionality Reduction and Algebraic Topology Benchmarking Peptide-Protein Docking and Interaction Prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer DomBpred: protein domain boundary predictor using inter-residue distance and domain-residue level clustering Unconventional conservation reveals structure-function relationships in the synaptonemal complex Sampling the conformational landscapes of transporters and receptors with AlphaFold2 Artificial Intelligence Guided Conformational Mining of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins AlphaFold Protein Structure Database: massively expanding the structural coverage of protein-sequence space with high-accuracy models PremPLI: a machine learning model for predicting the effects of missense mutations on protein-ligand interactions  ","permalink":"https://ninjani.github.io/FoldedWeekly/posts/4/","summary":"This week is co-evolution and structural variants, both disease-associated and otherwise","title":"Issue 4"},{"content":"SCoV2-MD: a database for the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and variant impact predictions Need an overview over the structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2? The database presented in this paper might be for you. Various models and experimental structures of protomers and oligomers in SARS-CoV-2 are presented together with a prediction of substrate and allosteric binding sites, protein-ligand docking, SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with human proteins and impacts of mutations on stability mapped to their respective structures.\nTwo-input protein logic gate for computation in living cells The authors design a \u0026ldquo;nano-computing agent\u0026rdquo;, a protein kinase that functions as a 2-bit logic OR gate. The first input, rapamycin, activates kinase activity and the second input, blue light, inactivates kinase activity. Analogous to hardware engineering complexities, inactivation wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fast as activation because of biological reasons. Similar setups could be applied to different kinds of proteins, giving us an arsenal of controllable protein agents for use in biomedicine and biotech.\nToward More General Embeddings for Protein Design: Harnessing Joint Representations of Sequence and Structure In Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, a transformer was trained on a huge dataset of sequences to embed proteins into a biologically meaningful learned embedding space. Here, the authors use this pre-trained model to generate sequence features, combine them with a graph representation of structures, and train a rotation and translation equivariant transformer to generate an embedding. This embedding performs better at mutation thermostability prediction likely because it\u0026rsquo;s able to take into account sequentially-distant structurally-close influences. Of course this structural information can come from computationally predicted structures as well, following the trend in this post-AlphaFold era of replacing or augmenting sequence-based approaches with structure.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 1: Summary of the workflow, landscapes, and splits. (A) General FLIP workflow: choose landscapes and splits that match user needs, train models and make predictions on the test set, and then compare to baseline models. (B) We choose landscapes that cover different types of sequence diversity. The GB1 landscape focuses on simultaneous mutation of four epistatic sites with nearly complete coverage [41] (PDB ID: 2GI9 [42]). The AAV capsid protein landscape sparsely samples sequences with up to 28 mutations, including insertions and deletions, to the the binding interface [43] (PDB ID: 6IH9 [44]). The thermostability landscape [45] measures a property shared by proteins from multiple functional groups across different domains of life. (C). We also provide up to seven suggested data splits for each landscape, which are described in Section 3.\n Source: FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins\nSome more  Computational design of nanoscale rotational mechanics in de novo protein assemblies Science Forum: Nanoscape, a data-driven 3D real-time interactive virtual cell environment FLIP: Benchmark tasks in fitness landscape inference for proteins Deep learning methods for designing proteins scaffolding functional sites ParaFold: Paralleling AlphaFold for Large-Scale Predictions #COVIDisAirborne: AI-Enabled Multiscale Computational Microscopy of Delta SARS-CoV-2 in a Respiratory Aerosol Computational Structural Genomics Unravels Common Folds and Novel Families in the Secretome of Fungal Phytopathogen Magnaporthe oryzae Contrastive learning on protein embeddings enlightens midnight zone at lightning speed Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins  ","permalink":"https://ninjani.github.io/FoldedWeekly/posts/3/","summary":"This week there\u0026rsquo;s SARS-CoV-2 structures, protein computing agents, and sequence-structure embeddings.","title":"Issue 3"},{"content":"A bundle of protein interactomes This week, three different papers addressing the 3-dimensional modelling of protein interactions at the cellular level were released, all paving the way to the automated and high-accuracy modelling of entire cells in 3D. The first, Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes, addresses the problem of predicting the composition and accurately modelling the 3D structure of protein macromolecular assemblies at the same time. The combination of RoseTTAFold for pair prediction with AlphaFold2 for structure modelling allowed for the construction of more than 1000 protein-protein assemblies from baker’s yeast. This not only included previously known interactions, but also more than 100 unknown others that may highlight previously unknown functions.\nIn the second paper, Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network, the authors use AlphaFold2 to model the 3-dimensional structure of more than 60’000 previously known protein interactions in the human proteome, providing building blocks to the construction of larger assemblies.\nBoth works pave the way to the modelling of the interaction networks and high-accuracy simulation of cells in 3D; something that can be now more easily done, as highlighted by the third paper, Building structural models of a whole mycoplasma cell. In this work, the authors used experimental and homology-modelled macromolecular structures and lattice-based models of a genome to generate the first 3D whole cell model of a eukaryote, Mycoplasma genitalium.\nIf we thought one year ago that the structural biology field was changed forever due to the onset of deep learning, advancements in computer graphics and whole cell simulations together with this boosting revolution will definitely change the way we study (molecular) biology.\nMining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome Using their previously developed predictor of antimicrobial efficacy for antimicrobial peptides (AMP), the authors of this paper identified 2603 AMPs encoded in the human proteome. A selection of 55 representative peptides show the capability to not only kill bacteria by targeting their membrane, they also do not readily select for antibiotic resistance and show anti-infective activity in mouse models. It is quite astonishing that a search algorithm based only on 3(!) physicochemical properties (net charge, hydrophobicity and length) was enough to find new promising candidates which were shown to be viable antibiotics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post about it too.\nIterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Antibody Sequence-Structure Co-design A fascinating protein design task, namely the joint design of an antibody sequence and 3D structure. The authors formulate this as a graph-generation problem and combine autoregressive models with iterative refinement to generate a full graph with node labels, edge labels and coordinates. In each generation step, the model learns to revise a current antibody graph and predict the label of the next residue. There\u0026rsquo;s one message passing network to predict the amino acid, and then another one to predict the new coordinates of all residues given the newly added amino acid. Unlike AlphaFold, this approach predicts the structure of an incomplete sequence without a specified MSA. This allows them to optimize the sequence-structure combo according to specific requirements. For instance, one of the validation experiments aims to identify neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 with sequence constraints such as low net charge, no glycosylation motifs, and no repeating stretches of amino acids. This level of control could be very useful for other protein design tasks as well.\nFigure of the Week    Figure 2. 3D-WC-MG recipe.

Short answer: No. Most of the predicted structures are in the holo or ligand-bound form, and predictions get worse when your protein is already conformationally diverse, probably because the evolutionary signal becomes fuzzy. Not all bad though - predicting holo forms is arguably more exciting than apo, and plDDT could be sensitive enough to detect different kinds of protein flexibility.\nThe case for post-predictional modifications in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Great news - since AlphaFold was trained using inter-residue distances from proteins in the PDB, it learned to leave space for co-factors and post-translational modifications. The authors graft glycans on a model and explain how other kinds of modifications could be added in as well. This is definitely a call to action:\n \u0026hellip; these early results are highly encouraging to serve as a rallying point for the developers’ community to complete and enrich the predicted protein models with likely modifications, to bring them to their fullest potential and to correctly inform the next generation of structural biology studies.\u0026quot;\n Artificial intelligence reveals nuclear pore complexity A Herculean feat - combining cryo-ET, cryo-EM, de novo structure and interface prediction, and coarse molecular dynamics to model the gigantic human nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold. There\u0026rsquo;s even a video\nhttps://twitter.com/jankosinski/status/1453530872427253765\nOverall a great demonstration of integrative structural biology with each step backed up by different technologies - predicted monomeric and complex structures were validated with new X-ray structures and fit to EM maps. The one that didn\u0026rsquo;t fit was remodelled and refined using RoseTTAfold and AlphaFold fragments. Information from the cryo-ET map was used to set up the MD simulation, which in turn matched previous experimental data about NPC constriction.\nApplications of AlphaFold beyond Protein Structure Prediction An interesting grab-bag of strategies, ideas, and preliminary experiments, ranging from mutational stability prediction to protein design. One of the first papers using the intermediate representations returned by AlphaFold instead of just the structure. These are essentially features per residue and predicted point mutation stability change pretty well.\nPre-training Co-evolutionary Protein Representation via A Pairwise Masked Language Model Using pairwise information while pre-training protein sequences makes the learned sequence representations much better at contact prediction.\nMultiple rereads of single proteins at single–amino acid resolution using nanopores And finally, something a little tangential and further off, Nanopore sequencing is coming to proteins! All these advancements move us ever closer to the futuristic sci-fi handheld device that you point at a sample in the field and instantly get a screen (holographic of course) of all the (PTM-ed) proteins and their (predicted) structures.\n","permalink":"https://ninjani.github.io/FoldedWeekly/posts/1/","summary":"This week we look at conformational diversity, post-translational modifications,\nintegrative structural modelling, pre-training protein sequences, and sequencing proteins.","title":"Issue 1"}]
