We are back just in time for easter! Here is some nice reading for over the (extra long) weekend :).

## [Errors in structural biology are not the exception](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798322011901)
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists scrambled to determine the structures of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 as fast as possbile. Evaluation of these structures by the Coronavirus Structural Task Force revealed that errors in these structures were not the exception. In this scientific comment, Gao et al. discusses errors in structural biology from a broader perspective: Why are errors so common? What are the possible consequences of errors? And what changes do we need to make to the structural biology community to become more resilient to errors?

## [Protein language models can capture protein quaternary state](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.30.534955)
Large language models specifically tailored to protein sequences are rapidly becoming more advanced and their usage base is growing. This paper explores if a current protein language model also incorporates information about the arrangement of multiple folded subunits, also known as the quarternary structure, and subsequently builds a model that can classify their number.

## [AB-Gen: Antibody Library Design with Generative Pre-trained Transformer and Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.17.533102)
Antibodies can be potent therapeutics for a great number of diseases, which is why a lot of effort is put into designing antibodies that are highly specific and have high affinity for their target. However, the optimization of lead antibodies is a very slow process, which is why in-silico pre-screening of potential leads is of great interest. In this paper, the authors present a method for antibody library design and present a number of test cases.
